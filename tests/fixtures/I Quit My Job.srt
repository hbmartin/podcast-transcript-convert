00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,490
Welcome to another episode of the map escaping podcast.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,300
My name is Daniel and this podcast is going to be a little bit different,

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,180
it's just me in the studio here today and by studio,

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,710
I mean my home office,

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:23,140
which is simply a spare bedroom in a house where I hang up a bunch of blankets and soft things around the room when I record to help sort of take the edge off the sound to take take away some of the vibration.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,310
So so let me start by introducing myself.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,140
My name is Daniel,

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,110
like I said before,

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,470
I'm 45 years old,

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,768
born and raised in new Zealand and I've been living in Denmark for the last 12 years.

11
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:32,528
I have a son,

12
00:00:32,538 --> 00:00:34,688
a daughter and a wife and a cat called Coco.

13
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,498
And I recently quit my job.

14
00:00:36,508 --> 00:00:37,958
I quit my job as a G.

15
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:38,068
I.

16
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:38,588
S.

17
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:40,898
Specialist slash consultant.

18
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:45,838
Let's not go into exactly what that job title means because it's it's very very broad,

19
00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:48,638
but I'm not just quitting that particular job,

20
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,528
I'm quitting being a G.

21
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:50,638
I.

22
00:00:50,638 --> 00:00:50,888
S.

23
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:52,668
Specialist slash consultant.

24
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,848
This is a big step when you're 45 years old,

25
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:59,788
I think maybe later on in another podcast episode I can go into the details of where I'm going from here,

26
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:01,586
but let's folk on quitting the job,

27
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:02,606
quitting being a G.

28
00:01:02,606 --> 00:01:02,686
I.

29
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:02,936
S.

30
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:06,316
Specialist slash consultant after 12 years in the industry,

31
00:01:06,486 --> 00:01:08,506
an industry that I was really excited to join.

32
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:09,586
How did I get here?

33
00:01:09,596 --> 00:01:12,216
Or the truth is what got me here was being bored.

34
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:15,936
I got really tired of doing boring work of solving boring problems,

35
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:21,056
but let's let's take a minute just to define what boring means or perhaps what I think it means.

36
00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:21,416
Well,

37
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,856
firstly everyone gets to decide what's boring for them,

38
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,016
boring is personal,

39
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:26,096
it's not universal,

40
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:28,616
boring is not the same as unimportant.

41
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:31,824
And I think of boring being the opposite of adventurous.

42
00:01:31,844 --> 00:01:37,264
When I finished high school in New Zealand I went to an outdoor recreation school where we trained to be outdoor guides.

43
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:41,264
So I spent two years doing this and I specialized in rock climbing and whitewater kayaking.

44
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:54,014
And at that school we had to think very hard about what an adventure was and when we were having an adventure and who we should take on an adventure and we sort of loosely defined adventure as being when the outcome was uncertain.

45
00:01:54,024 --> 00:02:01,022
So I think of boring is not adventurous boring is when the outcome is clear and you're not having an adventure.

46
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:03,582
But the thing about boring is is that it works,

47
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:06,002
it saves us from decision fatigue.

48
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:07,572
It's one less thing to think about,

49
00:02:07,582 --> 00:02:09,642
and boring is often desirable.

50
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:13,792
There are lots of things in my professional life that I want to be boring to be routine,

51
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:20,982
to be predictable and boring can be really motivating if you if you let it be and boring can also be a sign that you've evolved that you're,

52
00:02:20,982 --> 00:02:22,002
that you have moved on,

53
00:02:22,062 --> 00:02:34,610
that this what this task that you've been doing is no longer enough that you need something else and for me boring turned into frustration and it turned into apathy and it led to me quitting my job and wanting to move away from being a G.

54
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:34,690
I.

55
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:34,950
S.

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,750
Specialist slash consultant.

57
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,320
So after 12 years I'm done,

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,390
I'm ready to move on.

59
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,770
I want to share a few things that I've learned on my journey in the hope that will help you on your journey.

60
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,100
So like all good internet content creators,

61
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,400
I've made a list and I know what you're thinking.

62
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:48,990
Great.

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,100
Another list on the internet awesome.

64
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:57,200
But in this particular case it was really difficult to weave a story around these points that that I wanted to share with you.

65
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,138
So list seemed like a gray option.

66
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,748
It was an easy way for me to organize my thoughts.

67
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:05,368
Now I I realize I might end up contradicting myself from time to time,

68
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:10,748
but I hope you'll see past that and sort of look for for the deeper meaning and what I'm trying to convey here.

69
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:17,398
So the first thing on my list is boring work won't necessarily too interesting work at times during my career,

70
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,458
I found myself thinking if I get really good at doing this boring work,

71
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:24,938
someone will see how good I am at doing it and they'll give me more interesting problems to solve.

72
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:26,998
I think this is a really naive approach.

73
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:31,016
I think this is A variation of waiting to be picked,

74
00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:32,256
waiting to be discovered.

75
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:37,236
I don't think I no longer think it's good enough just to do good work or great work.

76
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:40,396
I think you need to be an advocate for yourself and the work that you're doing.

77
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:43,226
I think you need to market yourself and the work that you're doing.

78
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:44,566
I think you need to be proactive,

79
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,686
go out and look for interesting tasks,

80
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:48,226
interesting problems to solve.

81
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:49,966
And my approach of just thinking,

82
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,916
if I get really good at doing this boring work,

83
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:54,836
someone will see me that there was a bad strategy.

84
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:55,946
If I could go back in time,

85
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:56,986
I would do things differently.

86
00:03:56,996 --> 00:04:05,314
# two on my It kind of leads on from from number one and this is getting good at something typically leads to doing more of that thing.

87
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:08,204
So be intentional about what you want to excel in.

88
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:10,194
If you want to be a great cartographer,

89
00:04:10,204 --> 00:04:13,324
look for opportunities to do more photography.

90
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,474
If you don't want to go down that path,

91
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:16,124
don't do it.

92
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:20,204
Be intentional about what you decide you want to excel in.

93
00:04:20,354 --> 00:04:27,284
It will lead to more opportunities to do that thing and of course you can influence this if you want to be great at python,

94
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:28,242
do more python,

95
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:29,912
it will lead to you doing more python.

96
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:30,932
If you don't want to do this,

97
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:32,082
don't do it.

98
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:33,682
It sounds really silly when I say it,

99
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:34,982
but later on in my career,

100
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:36,212
I found myself trapped.

101
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:40,152
Like I got really good at doing this one particular task.

102
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:45,332
And so I quickly found myself in a box where that the opportunity was to do more of that particular task.

103
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:48,422
And after a while it became boring and I wanted to evolve and move on.

104
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:49,792
But I felt stuck.

105
00:04:49,802 --> 00:04:54,932
I wasn't intentional enough about where I was going and what I wanted to excel at.

106
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:56,822
So number three on my list is high.

107
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,210
Have more empathy for the professionals that I work with.

108
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,090
Maybe you've said a variation of this in your professional life,

109
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,970
something like it's all points lines and polygons to me,

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,530
this shows absolutely no empathy for the work that others are doing.

111
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,880
And each time I said that I painted myself into a corner,

112
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,030
I basically told people,

113
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,170
unless it was about points lines and polygons don't talk to this guy.

114
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,920
This was a huge mistake and I'm sure has led to so many missed opportunities.

115
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,070
And apart from that it's kind of selfish.

116
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,700
It's a really selfish thing to say.

117
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,388
I didn't like it when other people belittle my craft and yet I willingly did the same thing to them.

118
00:05:29,398 --> 00:05:30,958
So later on I got better at this.

119
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:31,728
But at the start,

120
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:32,868
I was terrible at this.

121
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:34,578
I was so focused on what I was doing,

122
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:40,388
that I couldn't see the overlap between what I was the work that I was doing and what other people were doing huge mistake.

123
00:05:40,398 --> 00:05:41,448
If I could go back in time,

124
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:42,508
I would be better at this,

125
00:05:42,578 --> 00:05:45,748
I would show more empathy for the other professionals that I'm working with,

126
00:05:45,758 --> 00:05:50,338
I would do a better job of understanding who I'm talking to and where they are trying to go.

127
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:52,548
So speaking of where they're trying to go,

128
00:05:52,558 --> 00:05:58,306
number four on my list is I would think more about where I was trying to go knowing that it was a moving target,

129
00:05:58,386 --> 00:06:00,196
that the goal wouldn't always be the same,

130
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:01,976
that it would change and evolve over time.

131
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:06,156
But just understanding that I was on a journey would have been really helpful to me.

132
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,456
It seems to me that people that have a goal are more likely to reach it,

133
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:12,426
but just wandering in the wilderness hoping things will work out.

134
00:06:12,426 --> 00:06:18,446
Just seems like a really sort of passive approach to such an important part of your life when you think about your career path.

135
00:06:18,456 --> 00:06:22,206
And also people would like to help you in the same way that you want to help them,

136
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,056
but they can't do that unless they know how to help you.

137
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:27,714
If you you can't say I am going in this direction,

138
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:29,064
I need these things,

139
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:30,474
can you help me with that?

140
00:06:30,484 --> 00:06:32,604
But then no one knows how to help you.

141
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:38,164
They can't help you even if they want to and they want to help you who doesn't want to see somebody else succeed.

142
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:40,524
Number five on my list is network.

143
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:41,624
I'm a total introvert,

144
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,724
I can't change this,

145
00:06:42,724 --> 00:06:44,184
I wouldn't want to change this,

146
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:45,364
but if I could go back in time,

147
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:49,124
I would force myself to be more social with my colleagues at the start,

148
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:53,814
I didn't understand that socializing was an investment in the people that I work with,

149
00:06:53,824 --> 00:07:01,452
It was a way of connecting to them and making me feel connected to something more than just my day to day tasks because I was so terrible at this,

150
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:07,122
it often left me feeling isolated and you might already feel isolated if you're a specialist,

151
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:11,532
it might be difficult to find sparring people that you can spar with people that can help you,

152
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:14,122
people that understand the task that that you're doing.

153
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:20,402
The combination of technical isolation and social isolation at work that this is a bad combination,

154
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:21,822
this is something to avoid.

155
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:22,972
If I could go back in time,

156
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:25,230
I would tell myself to be more social,

157
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,620
see it as an investment.

158
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,970
So number six on my list is mentorship.

159
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,030
I would get a mentor,

160
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,950
I would find someone,

161
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,570
I trusted someone who would tell it like it is someone who has either been there before,

162
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:42,510
who was on a similar journey and I would ask them questions and I would actively look for feedback and when I say feedback,

163
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,110
I think some people mistake when they ask for feedback,

164
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,280
what they're actually looking for is reassurance.

165
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,030
Reassurance is fantastic.

166
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,380
We all need reassurance,

167
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,360
but it is not the same as feedback,

168
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,050
I would actively look for fee,

169
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:55,868
feedback from my mentor,

170
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:59,028
I could have saved so much time and frustration.

171
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:00,718
If I found someone who could guide me,

172
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:05,078
you don't have to learn everything the hard way and if you can't stand on the shoulders of giants,

173
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:06,858
at least follow in their footsteps.

174
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:11,358
So the second thing on my list is sometimes it's just not a good fit.

175
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:13,678
If you try on some shoes and they don't fit,

176
00:08:13,688 --> 00:08:15,168
it's not your feet that are wrong.

177
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:16,108
It's the shoes,

178
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:17,478
the shoes don't fit you.

179
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:22,358
You need another pair of shoes walking in those shoes that don't fit you for years and years,

180
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:25,086
hoping that things will is not a good idea.

181
00:08:25,096 --> 00:08:27,096
I did this and it was a mistake.

182
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,826
Now I understand that changing your job,

183
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:33,516
changing your career is not as trivial as finding new shoes.

184
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:34,936
These are two very different things,

185
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:37,246
but I hope you understand where I'm trying to go here,

186
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:42,856
spending years of your life trying to force a round peg through a square hole is a bad idea.

187
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:45,976
And sure there's this idea of job crafting where it is.

188
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:46,356
Yeah,

189
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:48,086
you were given a square hole,

190
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:49,406
but you can change the whole,

191
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:50,726
you can make it a different shape.

192
00:08:50,726 --> 00:08:53,126
Maybe you can make it the same shape as what you are.

193
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:53,954
That's up to you,

194
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:55,934
but sometimes knowing when to quit,

195
00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:58,034
knowing when this is just not a good fit.

196
00:08:58,044 --> 00:09:05,124
The job doesn't fit me and not just accepting that learning to dance with it instead of beating yourself up over it.

197
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:07,884
So number seven is sometimes it's just not a good fit.

198
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:12,044
So number eight on my list is this You don't get to decide what is broken.

199
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,764
If your job is to help someone,

200
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:15,324
If you are in service,

201
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:17,434
working in service of someone else,

202
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:19,994
they decide what is broken as a professional,

203
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:22,604
your job is to guide them to help them under.

204
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:24,012
And the pros and cons.

205
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:25,542
You can show them other options.

206
00:09:25,552 --> 00:09:33,312
You might even decide to poke at the thing that you think is broken to agitate it and the hope of making it so painful that they are forced to move.

207
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,232
There's a lot of different strategies here.

208
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:35,802
But the point is,

209
00:09:35,802 --> 00:09:37,952
you don't get to decide what is broken.

210
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:39,492
If they think it's not broken,

211
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:40,572
then it's not broken.

212
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:45,592
And this might sound like a variation of that old saying that the customer is always right.

213
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:47,552
It's not that's not what I'm saying.

214
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:51,422
They're not always right understanding that you don't decide what is broken.

215
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:56,560
The client does Is recognizing that you can't change someone who's not ready to change.

216
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,140
So you can market to them.

217
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,060
You can try and make change happen if they don't think it's broken,

218
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,310
it's not broken and forcing someone to change who's not ready to change.

219
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,850
It doesn't want to change is simply going to create a lot of unnecessary tension,

220
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,860
frustration and at the end of the day everyone loses.

221
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,370
It doesn't have to be like that.

222
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,220
So that's it.

223
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,920
That's me.

224
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,160
That's where I'm at now on 45,

225
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,650
been working in the geospatial industry for 12.

226
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:26,378
I'm looking to make a dramatic career shift and if I could go back in time,

227
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:27,678
I would do these eight things,

228
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:29,348
I would tell myself these eight things.

229
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:33,008
So I'm telling you this because in the hope that will help you on your journey.

230
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:34,148
So this is my journey.

231
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:36,248
These are the things I've learned along the way.

232
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:36,508
Now,

233
00:10:36,518 --> 00:10:38,838
I realize I might have contradicted myself.

234
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:42,148
I realized that there will always be exceptions to the rule.

235
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:45,028
I'm not saying all of these things will apply to you.

236
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:48,058
I'm merely saying this is what I have learned along the way.

237
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:51,278
I hope that it helps you on your way on your journey.

238
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:51,486
So,

239
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:53,326
I really want this episode to be the first,

240
00:10:53,326 --> 00:10:57,316
in a short mini series of episodes are kind of behind the scenes,

241
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:58,806
look at different topics.

242
00:10:58,816 --> 00:10:59,186
So,

243
00:10:59,186 --> 00:10:59,576
obviously,

244
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,736
this one has been about my career,

245
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:04,506
the fact that I've quit my job and I'm moving on.

246
00:11:04,516 --> 00:11:07,176
I would also like to create a short episode,

247
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:07,576
kind of,

248
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:08,276
behind the scenes,

249
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:09,366
look at this podcast,

250
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:10,436
how it gets created,

251
00:11:10,446 --> 00:11:12,326
maybe touch on the marketing side of it,

252
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,186
and perhaps another episode about what?

253
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:15,006
How is this?

254
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:16,346
Where am I going now?

255
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:20,840
What what is the career path going to look like or where do I where am I trying to get to?

256
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,570
This is a work in progress,

257
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,050
I won't let it interrupt the typical weekly episodes that you're used to.

258
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,460
This will be something extra.

259
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,530
So if you've got this far in the episode,

260
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,420
if you're still listening,

261
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,650
I wonder if I could ask you for a favor.

262
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,780
I need help with with two things at the moment.

263
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:40,090
The first thing I'd like to ask your help with is growing this podcast.

264
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,050
So if you know someone that might find this podcast useful,

265
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,630
helpful,

266
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,400
entertaining,

267
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,140
whatever,

268
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,100
please share it with them.

269
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,560
Maybe you work at a university,

270
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,160
maybe you have access to a website.

271
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,430
Maybe,

272
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,900
you know,

273
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,680
community,

274
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,320
share a link to the podcast with them.

275
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,880
It would make a humongous difference to me and I would really appreciate it.

276
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,580
The second thing I'd like to ask your help with is I'm working with a company called Open Cage.

277
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:06,020
I'm good friends with the founder and together we're going to promote open street map projects.

278
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,120
So open cages,

279
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,310
a geo coder,

280
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,250
It runs on open street map data.

281
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,900
And this is a way of open cage giving something back to the community.

282
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:20,090
So the idea is that we find projects that are built on or around open street and we celebrate them.

283
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,530
We give them some exposure.

284
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,770
We tell people about them with.

285
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,920
The idea is to help people discover these projects.

286
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,020
Maybe they could get involved.

287
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,950
Maybe they can help.

288
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,330
Maybe they can push it forwards.

289
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,500
So there'll be a link to this in the show notes of this episode.

290
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,620
But if you don't want to follow the link and you know,

291
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,990
of an open street map project that you think is worth talking about,

292
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,020
you can either tweet at open cage or at Manscaping.

293
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,650
Okay.

294
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,390
That's it for me.

295
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,630
Thank you very much for listening all the way to the end.

296
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,570
I really appreciate it.

297
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,080
I hope this was helpful and we'll talk again soon.

298
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:47,520
Bye.
