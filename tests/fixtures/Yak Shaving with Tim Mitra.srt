00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:05,884
Thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy the rest of today's program.

15
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:11,645
Welcome to another episode of Empower Apps.

16
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:13,145
I'm your host, Leo Dion.

17
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:18,065
Today I am joined by once again at Tim Mitra . Tim, thank you so much for coming back on the show.

18
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:19,035
I really appreciate it..

19
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:20,685
Tim Mitra (guest): Hey, thanks for having me again.

20
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:22,095
Yeah.

21
00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:26,152
Leo Dion (host): In case people don't know you, I'll let you go ahead and introduce yourself and your podcasts.

22
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:27,652
Tim Mitra (guest): Sure.

23
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:29,911
I am an again, I'm sort of a creative type.

24
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:31,702
I'm a maker tinkerer.

25
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:38,736
And for the last 12 years or so, I've been basically working in
iOS a little bit of Mac, but mostly iOS primarily around the iPad.

26
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:39,246
Similar to you.

27
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:40,536
I started because of the iPad.

28
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:47,016
it had been doing like development before that, you know, apple reseller, that kind of thing.

29
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:54,904
But but the iPhone creating, you know, magic for people on the iPhone was
sort of what drove me on the iPad obviously, cuz it was a larger format.

30
00:01:54,913 --> 00:01:59,778
Yeah, so, you know, spent some time, early time teaching people how to do iOS when it was a new thing.

31
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:09,199
And yeah, I've had a chance to work with Apple a few times in a few different careers, but,
doing iOS and I think part of the, the idea behind the podcast, we do a couple of them.

32
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:14,304
I do one on sci-fi centered around Star Trek and other, but all kinds of other sci-fi.

33
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:20,399
But the main PO podcast I think people might know me for is more than just code, which is about iOS development.

34
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:26,280
And it's sort of our way of giving back to the community in terms of like, you know, some knowledge that we have.

35
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:30,885
App, app, reset, app, app developers, engineers, that kind of stuff.

36
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,849
And yeah, just, you know, we do it for the people

37
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:36,249
Leo Dion (host): and of course I was recently on there.

38
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:41,259
We'll have a link to that episode where we talked about a bunch of stuff, including vr Yeah.

39
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,329
And floppy disks and stuff.

40
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:45,549
So you'll definitely wanna check that one out.

41
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,880
What are you currently working on right

42
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,130
Tim Mitra (guest): now?

43
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,524
I'm currently engineering manager over at Spot Hero in Chicago.

44
00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:53,072
And  as well as working on some of my own sort of apps.

45
00:02:53,072 --> 00:03:00,599
I'm trying to do refactor a couple of things using SwiftUI and
iCloud, which iCloud and core data that we've talked about before.

46
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:01,257
Yep.

47
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:06,366
But to be honest with you, I have, I'm currently obsessed with the Red Dead Redemption 2.

48
00:03:06,381 --> 00:03:09,736
I've been spending way too much time playing that I should be writing code at night.

49
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:15,206
But, you know, I tend to write code at night and that's usually
what my hobby is, or 3D printing and that kind of stuff, but yeah.

50
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:15,416
Yeah.

51
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,366
I gotta gotta admit, the PlayStation's got me hooked, right.

52
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:19,126
Leo Dion (host): Isn't.

53
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:21,291
Became like three years old.

54
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:24,021
Tim Mitra (guest): It's many years old, but it's, it's actually really well done.

55
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:26,210
It's, it's it's funny, like I was thinking about that last night.

56
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,290
You know, I remember being a kid in a bowling alley in St.

57
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,700
Catherines, Ontario, or actually I guess Toronto.

58
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:39,219
Seeing Pong for the first time, and then shortly after Pong we
got, you know, Pacman and then, oh, space Invaders came after Pong.

59
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:39,489
Right.

60
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:50,969
So, and those, and you know, so I'm thinking, you know, like in the history of game development, like playing
Red Dead Redemption Two or the to Raider titles or Uncharted, you're like, if you're playing, you're in a movie.

61
00:03:51,604 --> 00:04:02,164
you know, in a sense, like the music's there, the, you know, the guitar, little subtle, you know, western guitar
in there and, you know, you're running around on a horse and everything looks pretty, you know, it's animated

62
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:15,077
admittedly, but it looks pretty realistic, you know, and, and we've come a long way from like, sort of eight bit
crappy graphics, you know, on a C R T screen, you know, to, to like, you know, 4K stereo surround sound, you know.

63
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:15,977
Leo Dion (host): Totally.

64
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:16,277
Yeah.

65
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:19,844
So, so we had a couple of things we wanted to talk about today.

66
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:26,369
One of the things you wanted to talk about was what you think most people are missing when they're developing an app.

67
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:34,813
As far as like, just kinda like buzzwords or trends that you see . That you think could be possibly misleading.

68
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,879
And what you think people should really be be doing when they're building.

69
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:40,679
A big project, I guess, or

70
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:43,649
Tim Mitra (guest): even a small Yeah, I, I think it's true of any, any project you work on.

71
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:44,009
I see.

72
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:50,679
and this is based on a lot of stuff that I see on, on the interwebs
and the socials on the Twitter and the, and the Mastodons and Facebook.

73
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:57,787
Well, not so much Facebook, I don't talk to engineers on Facebook, but . I do talk to
engineers who work on Facebook, but I don't talk to and people on Facebook about that.

74
00:04:57,816 --> 00:05:05,100
But yeah, I think the, the, you know, you hear a lot of things like, especially from
new users who are just getting into the game, like, what should I, should I do UIKit?

75
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,270
Should I do SwiftUI?

76
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,240
Should I, you know, should I do Core data?

77
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,200
Should I do react?

78
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,700
You know, should I do flutter?

79
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,480
What should I learn?

80
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:20,718
. And I mean, the reason why my podcast is called More Than Just Code is literally because
I believe that there is more than just writing code to building an an app, right?

81
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:29,008
I've said it many times before that, you know, it's, it's writing the code, it's, it's creating the user
experience, it's creating surprise and delight is what Apple would like us to do with our apps, right?

82
00:05:29,054 --> 00:05:31,994
So there's a lot of, a lot of avenues to building an app.

83
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:36,584
You have to think about marketing or even a building, a bu it's
kind of like building a little mini business, if you think about it.

84
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:37,494
I mean, if you're.

85
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:43,769
for the sake of putting an app on the app store, which I've done, I've
just put apps up there just for the sake of, of going through the exercise.

86
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:48,788
You know, then it, it comes down to, you know, you have to evaluate the, the why.

87
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:49,808
Why are you doing this?

88
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:50,708
What's your reason?

89
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:54,308
Are you doing this because you wanna make a living at it?

90
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:58,838
Are you doing this because you want to, you know, build a portfolio, whatever your intent is.

91
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:00,698
And that's true of any sort of creative process.

92
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:04,158
And I believe that writing code and making apps is a creative process.

93
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:06,108
You'd have to sort of evaluate what your intention is.

94
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:07,428
Are you just doing it for fun?

95
00:06:07,548 --> 00:06:08,508
Are you doing it for profit?

96
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:10,068
You know, what's your motivation?

97
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:17,211
I'm very empathetic to the user or the customer's, clients, you know, and, and
calling them users is sort of an engineering term, but maybe we should, we should

98
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:20,631
some, some, some companies I work for, they, they kind of change that terminology.

99
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,891
We're not allowed to call 'em users, but.

100
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,795
because it kind of takes the humanity out of them.

101
00:06:25,822 --> 00:06:30,892
I'm a big advocate for security and for accessibility as one of my big pet peeves.

102
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:37,102
And especially since, you know, I'm, I'm wearing an accessibility
device, a pair of glasses, you know, got the gray hair going here, right?

103
00:06:37,102 --> 00:06:49,047
So, so, you know, I use larger type, you know, so, I've been, you know, I wasn't really big into the
dark mode, sort of, you know, the, the xcode with your screen color reversed and all that kinda stuff.

104
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:53,045
I still code in, you know, plain old boarding, boring white.

105
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:58,625
But I like, you know, I like it sunset that my, my devices all switched to a dark mode, right?

106
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,155
I've gone through all my websites.

107
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:05,320
I've added dark mode to the website, so that, , you know, at
that time of day everything switches and, and that kind of stuff.

108
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:16,401
But I think that there's, I think one of the biggest pieces that I find missing in a lot of teams and
a lot of apps is that there's a very large percentage of the world that have some sort of impairment

109
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:23,321
in terms of either visual or auditory or, you know, there's, even as you get older, you, you know, we.

110
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:30,770
We all get to a point where we need some accessibility devices,
and I think that's a huge thing that's missing in a lot of apps.

111
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,720
And, and of course, you know, there's also the.

112
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,360
The other, other side of the argument that you hear a lot about is testing, right About, about writing unit tests.

113
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:46,396
And it's funny cuz I, I saw a tweet on the weekend and from a friend of ours and I said,
you know oh, I thought we were developing apps, not, you know, delivering tests, right?

114
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:50,596
Because it seems to be, there's a lot of emphasis on is it testable code?

115
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:55,426
You know, are we, are we using mvvm simply for the sake of, you know, the story that it's easier to test?

116
00:07:55,426 --> 00:07:58,006
Or, or are we doing that because it's a good architectural pattern?

117
00:07:58,576 --> 00:08:00,286
I think those are questions that.

118
00:08:00,372 --> 00:08:07,392
People need to ask themselves, but I remember something, I think it was Brent Simmons
said once about one of his apps is, God, don't look at the code under the hood.

119
00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:08,442
The app looks great.

120
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:09,222
People love it.

121
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:16,482
You know, it ships, it does, does what it needs to do, but please don't, you
know, like I don't look, I'm embarrassed by some of my coding decisions, right?

122
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:17,562
Over the years.

123
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:23,132
And there's a few people who, friends of mine who's Mark, mark
on our podcast has seen my code and he shakes his head a lot.

124
00:08:23,742 --> 00:08:35,579
But you know, the the the reality is, is, you know if it, and we talked about on my, I think we talked about on our show
the other day, the other day, about the 80 20 rule where, you know, , you don't have to focus on per, per perfection.

125
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:37,079
You should focus on progress.

126
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:37,149
Yep.

127
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:37,739
Right?

128
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:41,879
And, you know, sometimes you just need to ship a product to get it out the door.

129
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:45,046
So you know the 80% of the work is done.

130
00:08:45,346 --> 00:08:46,096
Let's get it out there.

131
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:46,876
Let's see what happens.

132
00:08:46,915 --> 00:08:54,097
. You know, I think another I've been fortunate to work on teams lately that have a good quality assurance group, right?

133
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:59,857
People whose specific job is to just test the apps, make, you know, do the dumb things that the users are gonna do.

134
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:04,567
I'm always amazed, like I was tease my QA people that they're stop breaking my app, right?

135
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:05,737
I wrote it, it's fine.

136
00:09:05,737 --> 00:09:06,397
It works, right?

137
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:09,771
Stop, stop, stop finding the edge cases that, that make things grief.

138
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:13,191
But I think that, and it's funny because I've talked to a lot of teams.

139
00:09:14,526 --> 00:09:22,526
and you know, I was doing the whole interview process for like 18
months and a lot of teams are, you know, I said, who does your qa?

140
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:25,416
Well, our, our dev, our engineers do the QA themselves.

141
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:27,096
Bad idea.

142
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:35,596
Like, you know, I think you need to have an impartial person who doesn't necessarily
understand engineering, who goes in and, and actually tests the device, test the.

143
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:36,721
To find

144
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:37,061
Leo Dion (host): the weakness?

145
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:43,231
Well, one of the things I see benefit of QA is like, I don't know, especially if it's a pretty big app.

146
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:46,051
I don't know every nook and cranny of that app.

147
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:49,291
Like, I don't know, oh, this was supposed to do this.

148
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:50,371
Oh, I didn't know that.

149
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:56,701
Like I could, I could develop something according to what I think
it's supposed to do, but I might not know what the user expects.

150
00:09:57,121 --> 00:10:08,996
And I think that's like a big problem as far as like, The difference between QA and unit testing,
like whereas unit testing, it's just like, oh, just make sure my code runs the way I expect it to.

151
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:12,027
But sometimes what you expect is not what you are.

152
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,981
User or customer expects,

153
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:14,341
Tim Mitra (guest): right?

154
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:15,361
Yeah.

155
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:20,671
And, and the unit test just proves that your logic is sound and, and that, that, you know, it responds well.

156
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:22,141
And there's also automation testing.

157
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:29,581
I think that's a lot of something that people should consider as well is, is, you
know, what happens if I log in repeatedly for 10 minutes or something like that?

158
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:30,841
You know, those kind of Right.

159
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:32,491
That's where automation happens, right?

160
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:33,691
And that's where, I mean mm-hmm.

161
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:34,171
in.

162
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,929
. And the other thing too, that that's, it's, it's challenging as you,
as your point about QA is, you know, I just transitioned to a new team.

163
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:42,809
So it's an, it's an, a mature app that's been developed for a long time.

164
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:50,612
And I did the same thing when I joined the bank back, you know, six and a half,
seven years ago coming into a code base and nooks and crannies, I mean, like there

165
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:53,972
are parts of the banking app that I never looked at in the six years I was there.

166
00:10:53,972 --> 00:10:54,242
Right.

167
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:54,812
I know.

168
00:10:55,382 --> 00:10:56,222
I just know there weren't.

169
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,482
Right, right, right.

170
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:07,442
So it's difficult to sort of, it's difficult to sort of transition into a new team where the, the app is mature
and I think that may be a challenge, something that people should consider if they, if they move to a big group.

171
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:08,462
Right, right.

172
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:15,295
It's nice to have Greenfield development where, you know, the, the, we're
all only working as SwiftUI and we're only working with the new stuff.

173
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:16,045
It's, that's nice.

174
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:20,185
But the reality is, you know, in a lot of cases, you're supporting older devices.

175
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:27,850
You're working with, you know,  design decisions that may have been, may
have worked a while ago, but don't work anymore kind of thing, right?

176
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,540
So, mm-hmm.

177
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,230
. Yeah.

178
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:29,770
Leo Dion (host): Yeah.

179
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:30,970
Excuse me.

180
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:45,295
One of the things I was gonna say is, As far as testing, like I think, I think there's a divide in the
community when it comes to the difference between like solo apps and apps that are built with large teams.

181
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:45,445
Mm-hmm.

182
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:54,535
, because I feel like there's kind of two, two sides that are like talking a different, like,
almost like a different language where it's like where you say, oh, like don't look at my code.

183
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:55,465
It's horrible.

184
00:11:55,495 --> 00:12:06,655
Like, That's fine, I guess if you're a solo developer, but if you're on a big team where like
several people have to manage it, that's where having testability is even more important, I guess.

185
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:07,165
You know what I mean?

186
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,960
Tim Mitra (guest): Yeah.

187
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,950
Coding standards too.

188
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,200
I mean, like, you know, you have to agree on, right?

189
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:19,473
I mean, the biggest challenge of moving to a big team, especially as a, as an
individual engineer is do you understand the, the requirements for the team?

190
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:22,053
Not, not, I'm not talking about the accepting requirement for the ticket.

191
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:26,253
I'm talking about, you know, are we, are we running things like swift land?

192
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:28,593
Are we, you know, cause we, you know, we used to.

193
00:12:29,018 --> 00:12:30,038
Swift link came along.

194
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:37,359
We used to use like a, there was a clang something, or rather we ran an xcode
to, okay, clean up our objective C you know, are we leaving, you know you know,

195
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:41,848
are, are, is, are we, you know, bringing up all of our declarations and methods?

196
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:43,948
Are we, are we not using extra white space?

197
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:46,198
Because white space makes it readable as a human.

198
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:49,708
Yes, but it's not as a team, maybe we decided to get rid of that.

199
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:53,308
You know, we don't, we don't want everything tightened up and less lines of code, as it were.

200
00:12:53,758 --> 00:12:55,438
Cause white space accounts as a line.

201
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:55,678
Right.

202
00:12:55,683 --> 00:13:02,609
But, And then, you know, are we using, like, I love the the, I
guess they're called Kodaco now, the Ray Weder, like folks, right?

203
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:08,724
They used to publish and they, I think they still do publish a swift like swift rules, sort of Swift guidelines.

204
00:13:08,729 --> 00:13:10,824
They used to do an objective C guidelines as well, right?

205
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:10,914
Yep.

206
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:14,574
And sort of the team can look at those recommendations and agree.

207
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:16,678
And then is it, what's the one from Realm?

208
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:17,718
Is it Swift Lint?

209
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:19,473
JP and yeah, the JP

210
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:21,233
Leo Dion (host): wrote swiftformat.

211
00:13:21,423 --> 00:13:23,193
Tim Mitra (guest): I think Swift format, that's what I'm thinking of.

212
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:23,523
Yeah.

213
00:13:23,523 --> 00:13:24,093
The, the

214
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:25,743
Leo Dion (host): no or Nick Lockwood is swift format.

215
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:26,583
Realm is swift

216
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,093
Tim Mitra (guest): Lint, right?

217
00:13:27,093 --> 00:13:27,293
Yeah.

218
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:27,663
Right.

219
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:27,933
Yeah.

220
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:36,250
So between the two of those, you know, there's sort of a, and you can accept their
suggestions as, as your rules, or you can, or you can use them as guidelines, as I said.

221
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:36,640
Right.

222
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:42,414
And then decide, your team can decide whether you want to do them and
what's nice about those automation process, and you can customize.

223
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:43,294
Yeah.

224
00:13:43,294 --> 00:13:48,569
And these are part of your, your ci your, your, your continued integration, continuous development.

225
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,408
You can have those as scripts.

226
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:54,158
You can either run locally on your machine or you can have them on your build servers that Yep.

227
00:13:54,248 --> 00:13:57,008
Run the things and reject your PRS based on that.

228
00:13:57,008 --> 00:14:05,235
And dangers another important tool I think that, that is really nice that, you
know, it's like a, an extra engineer looking at, at the quality of your code, right?

229
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:07,245
So yeah, with the rules you put in danger.

230
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:08,325
Leo Dion (host): Yep.

231
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:09,585
Have you heard of strings?

232
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:12,165
Lint Speaking of accessibility?

233
00:14:12,555 --> 00:14:12,915
No.

234
00:14:13,155 --> 00:14:13,545
What's that one?

235
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:17,311
So strings lint is, it makes sure that you use.

236
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:19,505
String dictionaries and mm-hmm.

237
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,902
Localization for all the strings you use in your ui.

238
00:14:23,002 --> 00:14:23,242
Oh, yeah.

239
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:24,682
Tim Mitra (guest): Language support's another important one.

240
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:25,012
Yeah.

241
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:25,612
Leo Dion (host): Yeah.

242
00:14:26,002 --> 00:14:30,322
Which, if you're interested in accessibility and localization, we've done episodes on that.

243
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:30,922
Definitely.

244
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:31,222
Check that.

245
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:31,502
Oh yeah.

246
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:32,142
To check that one out.

247
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:41,242
Yeah, cuz I have, I have an app and it's like, I wanna make sure all my strings aren't just a, because
you know, when you first start you'll be like, oh, I'm just gonna write these strings and code.

248
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:47,936
But then eventually you could start using it'll warn you and say, Hey, you
should probably put this in a string dictionary since in your, it's in your ui.

249
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:50,306
So I haven't recommend checking that out.

250
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:56,600
Tim Mitra (guest): Yeah, I mean, I've always used localization and all
of my apps, the, my early apps were like supporting eight languages.

251
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,730
One of them was supporting 14, which was just crazy.

252
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,785
But, Yeah.

253
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,495
But, but, but it's, it's important.

254
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:03,825
I mean, like, you know, we're not, it is important.

255
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:08,105
We're not the, it's not English speak people and people who read, you know, left to right.

256
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,095
I have to think about that for a minute.

257
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:11,585
We're not the only people using your app, right?

258
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:11,785
Yeah.

259
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,506
So so that's another important consideration.

260
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:15,970
And obviously a market too.

261
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:24,340
I mean, you know, Canada's like a 10th the size of the United States in terms of
market, but then China is 10 times, 10 times the US or a hundred times the US I think.

262
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:25,630
Right, right, right.

263
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:32,625
So, You know, and it's funny cuz we, you know, in in, I worked in Canadian
banking and obviously Canada, our two official languages are English and French.

264
00:15:32,635 --> 00:15:33,195
Right?

265
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,315
Right.

266
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:42,495
The majority of us speak English, I mean, sorry, French people, but I'm sure in some provinces
it's, you know, very French and some, some are bi fully, one province is fully bilingual.

267
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:42,765
Right.

268
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:46,845
But, you know, so you think, okay, well I need to add English and French into my app.

269
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:47,175
Right?

270
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:53,715
What we, what I, we didn't realize was a large, a very large percentage of our users are Chinese.

271
00:15:54,355 --> 00:15:54,915
, right.

272
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:55,395
Okay.

273
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:01,195
So, so we had to, we, you know, in the banking app we added English, French, and then we started adding Chinese.

274
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:10,315
And that that sort of got, you know, a lot of, lot of people, I mean there were even
people in Quebec who are Chinese whose, whose fallback language is French, not English.

275
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:11,125
Right?

276
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,685
So these are things you sort of, that, that come up in, in, especially in larger ops.

277
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:23,305
I mean, I think I was, I was gonna go down this one rabbit hole was
that, you know, the banking app was u was used by 6 million people a day.

278
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:24,595
right?

279
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,445
Like that's huge numbers, right?

280
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,885
In terms of people who's using it, right?

281
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:34,405
So I mean, all the more reason that be accessible, support, accessibility, dynamic type and that kind of stuff.

282
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:34,615
Right.

283
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:35,815
Leo Dion (host): Do

284
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:38,815
you think one, one thing you wanted to talk about, and this gets into.

285
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,060
Other cultures.

286
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,480
Other languages as, yeah, multidisciplinary engineering.

287
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,610
What, what, yeah.

288
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,630
What does that mean, I guess, and how do you think that's helpful?

289
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,220
Tim Mitra (guest): Did I put that down there?

290
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:57,685
? . I think I, yeah, I think, I think what it meant by multi multidisciplinary
engineering was what they sometimes call cross-functional engineering as well.

291
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:58,645
Where Okay.

292
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,830
It's not just an isolated instance where you're in io.

293
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,515
You know, you may be dealing with you may be dealing, you're obviously dealing with endpoints
if you do any kind of, any kind of data stored on a network or any kind of user account stuff.

294
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:14,038
So I think what I meant by that was, was, I'd have to go back to my notes now but I think I meant.

295
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:20,914
Like, you know thinking about the engineering across CROK teams or across, across different silos, right?

296
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:23,254
In terms of like what you're, you're dealing with.

297
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:26,688
I mean, like I, in my own apps, you know, I write my own APIs, right?

298
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:28,788
So I do PHP and my sql.

299
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:29,558
Okay.

300
00:17:29,563 --> 00:17:36,408
And so, so you, you know, you need, need to know those things and, and you
know, then if you've got Android support, you might need to know Kotlin.

301
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:39,258
You know, have somebody on the team who knows Kotlin, right.

302
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:41,778
And Java to be able to support those kind of things.

303
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:44,148
I think that's what I meant by multidisciplinary engineering.

304
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:46,594
It's not just again, the more than just code comment, right?

305
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:48,034
what?

306
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,368
More than just Iowa's code, I mean,

307
00:17:50,063 --> 00:17:50,423
Leo Dion (host): Right.

308
00:17:50,514 --> 00:17:54,924
I'm almost surprised at how many iOS tab don't know anything about backend development.

309
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:59,498
Yeah, but it, I mean, it kind of makes sense if that's all you've been doing.

310
00:17:59,498 --> 00:18:08,283
But what do you, if you were an iOS developer, let's say I was a iOS developer, and I asked you Hey, what should I do?

311
00:18:08,313 --> 00:18:11,373
What should I learn if I wanted to be branch out?

312
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:13,533
Or what would you recommend being

313
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:14,193
Tim Mitra (guest): first up?

314
00:18:14,423 --> 00:18:14,663
Mm.

315
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:22,600
Well, I mean, I'm, I'm a fan of PHP from way back when, but the, I think,
you know, Python is an important language to Mark, mark Rubin from Morgan.

316
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,910
Just code would be telling you to learn Python for sure.

317
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,890
That's, I think, his favorite language.

318
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,480
I mean, there's things like Go GOs used a lot in, in backend work these days.

319
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,250
No, JS is another important one.

320
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,410
Leo Dion (host): Yeah, I was gonna say node, node type script, because that opens up a whole world type script

321
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:38,530
is

322
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,430
Tim Mitra (guest): sort of built on top of.

323
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,740
Or is it

324
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,750
Leo Dion (host): further Java built on top of JavaScript?

325
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,020
Yeah.

326
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:43,530
Right.

327
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:43,650
Yeah.

328
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,850
But anything like that where you can open the whole world, a web to you right.

329
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:49,636
Would be super, super useful.

330
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:51,505
Obviously I'm a big fan of backend

331
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:54,955
Tim Mitra (guest): paper and I was listening to your show with, with Sarah other today, swift.

332
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,290
Leo Dion (host): So like that's an option.

333
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:05,293
But I mean, that'll, that'll, I think that's good for teaching you
how, how to like, query a database or how to like build a rest api.

334
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:12,433
But as far as like learning another language, I think JavaScript type script would
be super helpful cuz then you can like do all sorts of stuff on webpages and things

335
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:12,793
Tim Mitra (guest): like that.

336
00:19:13,123 --> 00:19:17,053
Yeah, I think it's very important to understand the contract between yourself and the backend too.

337
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:17,323
Right?

338
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,163
Like, you know.

339
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:18,343
Right.

340
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:24,962
We currently, like, you know, when I started iOS, we were doing,
you know Pless, which are xml, we were learning how to XML parse.

341
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:25,232
Right.

342
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:29,620
And, and then, you know, I think, don't remind me uh, JSON came along and know the horror stories, right?

343
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:30,130
Yeah.

344
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,887
JSON came along and now we have the json, you know decoding and encoding protocols.

345
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:34,947
Yeah.

346
00:19:34,947 --> 00:19:43,436
We have the, the, you know, And as coder for binary phs, you know,
storing them, bringing 'em back to life, re reinflating them if you will.

347
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:52,027
You know, it kind of reminds me of, of astronauts going to the moon, the way they would dehydrate
their food and they would use water to reinflate them, to make them into look a nice mm-hmm.

348
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:52,327
Yeah.

349
00:19:52,327 --> 00:19:52,597
Steak.

350
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:53,257
Exactly.

351
00:19:54,097 --> 00:19:56,085
But , the, you know, so there's that.

352
00:19:56,085 --> 00:20:02,586
And then, and now we've got the Code Codeable Pro protocol in, in swift to be able to handle that kind of stuff for us.

353
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:08,856
And yeah, you know, under the hood there's a lot going on, but, you know,
from a user point of view, it's, you know, pretty, pretty straightforward.

354
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:15,025
So, but I think, you know, understanding you know, looking at
like under learning about how, you know, basic http works, right?

355
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:20,575
Like how, you know, TLS works and encryption, you know, importance of encryption and importance of se.

356
00:20:20,815 --> 00:20:27,985
It leads into the security discussion about, you know, making
sure that you're, you're talking to your, your backend correctly.

357
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:30,475
You're not, you know, exposing secrets.

358
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,235
You're not taking a user of password, for example, and passing around a plain text bad idea, you know?

359
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,500
You know, there's all kinds of different things that you can do there to, to sort of wreck somebody's day.

360
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:41,770
Right.

361
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,681
But by yeah.

362
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:50,031
I, I just, I shuder every time I hear one of these new, oh, so-and-so's been
exploited and so-and-so's, you know, change your passwords on this thing.

363
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:54,291
And, you know, it's getting old, just, it's just, it just scares the heck outta me.

364
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:54,441
Right.

365
00:20:55,641 --> 00:21:00,381
Leo Dion (host): How do you think project management fits into this as far as.

366
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:02,241
Take a step back.

367
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:04,161
We, we talked about helping developers.

368
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:04,551
Mm-hmm.

369
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:11,211
learn, but like, as far as for if you're managing a team, like what do you think is the role of a project manager?

370
00:21:11,211 --> 00:21:11,541
What do you.

371
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:13,236
They're, they're missing out

372
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:13,476
Tim Mitra (guest): on.

373
00:21:14,046 --> 00:21:16,776
Yeah, it kind of de, it depends on the, depends on the company as well.

374
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:22,866
Like cuz the different def definitions, like larger companies, like a
bank would, would have like that broken down into four different roles.

375
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:26,316
Whereas a smaller startup might have it like all compacted into one.

376
00:21:26,316 --> 00:21:29,466
But I, I know of an engineer here in Toronto pretty successful.

377
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:35,911
Solo developer who use uses project management tools just to keep himself on the street and narrow.

378
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:39,301
And I've thought about doing that, like thought about using tools like Trello.

379
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:43,698
Like at Koca we use Trello for managing our projects, but also Jira.

380
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:45,108
I'm a big fan of Jira.

381
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,718
I mean, not a huge fan of mean, it's the tool you use.

382
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:51,828
I know a friend of mine who's on monday.com who's shaking his fist at the screen right now.

383
00:21:51,828 --> 00:21:53,802
But you know, it's just a matter it, I think.

384
00:21:54,152 --> 00:21:58,664
It allows you to take, and it's part of, sort of agile flow that you want to basically take.

385
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:02,847
My agile joke by the way, is how do you, how do you eat an elephant?

386
00:22:03,897 --> 00:22:06,117
You know, one bite at a time, right?

387
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:14,002
So you so basically take any large complex job and you break it down into smaller chunks.

388
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:14,182
Right.

389
00:22:14,182 --> 00:22:15,712
And I think that's what Agile does, right?

390
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:22,382
And, and if you're using a tool like using something like Confluence to document what the, what the, the ticket's about.

391
00:22:23,192 --> 00:22:28,982
you know, take the, the actual tasks of what you're gonna put
together in terms of an app and break it down into those steps.

392
00:22:28,982 --> 00:22:30,272
What do I need to do first?

393
00:22:30,272 --> 00:22:31,352
What do I need to do second?

394
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:31,442
Yeah.

395
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:33,032
Is a dependency here and there.

396
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:40,842
So tools like Jira and Trello help you sort of organize all the pieces like
you were, I think you were mentioning about you know, Ulysses as an example.

397
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:44,803
I think my friend Tammy is a big fan of s Scribner for writing, right?

398
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:45,223
Mm-hmm.

399
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:49,313
writing stories, writing novels, writing, you know, Well, it's your short story or a long story.

400
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:49,373
Yeah.

401
00:22:49,553 --> 00:22:51,113
Leo Dion (host): You, you have to break it down into pieces.

402
00:22:51,113 --> 00:22:57,143
Tim Mitra (guest): It's way too overwhelming, but you need to gather all your bits
and pieces into like a sort of a treasure box and scrapbook them kind of thing.

403
00:22:57,323 --> 00:22:58,154
And I think that's what I think it's.

404
00:22:59,063 --> 00:23:01,733
, 
Leo Dion (host): I think Ulysses calls a material sheet, right?

405
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:02,633
I think that's the term

406
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:03,113
Tim Mitra (guest): they use.

407
00:23:03,163 --> 00:23:03,523
Yeah.

408
00:23:03,593 --> 00:23:03,953
Yeah.

409
00:23:03,953 --> 00:23:12,803
So, and Scribner has a sort of like a sort of sketch board kind of place where you kind, you collect all
the bits and pieces that are gonna make up your story, your story lines, your character developments mm-hmm.

410
00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:13,283
and that kind of stuff.

411
00:23:13,283 --> 00:23:13,643
Yeah.

412
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:17,073
But I think, I think a tank in those same sort of, kind of criteria.

413
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,320
I do the same thing in my artwork.

414
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:25,250
I, I break it down into, into what has to happen first, what, you know,
I need to gather the supplies I need to, you know, have the stuff.

415
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,680
To go in order to, to basically get the project from one place to another.

416
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:37,928
And I think that's the same thing's true with, with any kind of mobile
development or even websites is, is you need to break it down into small pieces.

417
00:23:37,928 --> 00:23:48,290
Like and maybe this is something that a, a, a young new developer can think about is like, you
know, like for instance, I have a, an app on a store or like a tutorial on using Touch id, right?

418
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,740
So I wanna use Touch id, Hey Lou Leo, I wanna use Touch id right?

419
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,340
. Well, what do I need to do first?

420
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,360
Well, first of all, I need to have some sort of app that requires login, right?

421
00:23:57,365 --> 00:23:57,660
Mm-hmm.

422
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,580
. And so then I have to create a login view, and then I have to create,
you know, then I have to be able to handle the username and the password.

423
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,640
And as I said before, you don't want to handle that on Plain Tech.

424
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,920
So now you need to figure out a way to obfuscate.

425
00:24:08,445 --> 00:24:09,975
The input from the user.

426
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:14,865
And then you need to have a way to talk to, maybe you wanna store something in user defaults key chain.

427
00:24:14,895 --> 00:24:15,795
Okay, that's fine.

428
00:24:15,795 --> 00:24:23,625
Maybe I want to use key chain, so then I have to go and learn about key chain,
you know, and, and break down all the pieces that, that you need to do in order to

429
00:24:23,637 --> 00:24:27,807
facilitate getting to the point where you can actually add touch ID to your screen.

430
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:28,107
Right?

431
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:28,707
Yeah.

432
00:24:28,822 --> 00:24:36,749
You know, so and we should probably talk about yak shaving at some point too, but, The, you know, the idea is like you.

433
00:24:37,454 --> 00:24:40,034
You have a complex task to do.

434
00:24:40,088 --> 00:24:49,598
And one of the things we did early, early, early in the days was when we were writing our iOS stuff is,
you know, we weren't the experts on it cuz I don't don't think anybody was in the early days, right?

435
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:58,838
So one of my junior's jobs was to just scour the web for a solution that's already been written
and somebody already written something about this that already does this thing rather than.

436
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:01,218
trying to invent it yourself, right?

437
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:04,728
Like one of the things about security is don't try to invent your own security.

438
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:05,868
It's already been done.

439
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:06,978
It's already been proven.

440
00:25:07,428 --> 00:25:11,388
There are best practices, you know, you should, you should probably check that out, right?

441
00:25:11,568 --> 00:25:12,798
Rather than trying to do it yourself.

442
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:14,455
But yeah.

443
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:17,135
Leo Dion (host): Do you use.

444
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:26,345
. Yeah, so I, I pretty much, I think I mentioned this, I don't
know, but I use like a spreadsheet to keep track of my to-do list.

445
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:26,545
Mm-hmm.

446
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,085
, but when Right.

447
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:35,387
I've individual repos or projects and GitHub has this now GitLab has, has like their little Jira Yeah.

448
00:25:35,637 --> 00:25:44,667
Trello thing, and then I'll put those individual tasks and then I'll organize
those into a Trello board of some sort for like projects, coding projects.

449
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:44,907
So to.

450
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:46,572
. 
Tim Mitra (guest): Yeah.

451
00:25:46,572 --> 00:25:48,492
I just wanna show you here on, on my phone.

452
00:25:48,492 --> 00:25:51,900
I mean so, you know, like one, one of the things I do in, in, yeah.

453
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,280
So here, like for instance, I've started doing, using my, I dunno if you can get the clear shot of this.

454
00:25:56,314 --> 00:25:57,034
Leo Dion (host): It's too bright.

455
00:25:57,034 --> 00:25:57,814
I can't see it.

456
00:25:58,414 --> 00:25:59,014
Too bright.

457
00:25:59,014 --> 00:25:59,164
There

458
00:25:59,164 --> 00:25:59,554
Tim Mitra (guest): we go.

459
00:25:59,614 --> 00:25:59,944
How's that?

460
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:00,124
There you go.

461
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:01,009
, right?

462
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:06,319
So you can see that, you know, I've got user stories and I'm using the notes featured to make little check boxes.

463
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:12,949
And this is just a simple, I broke this, you know, in terms of what I
want to refactor in the app is I broke down what it is I want to do.

464
00:26:12,949 --> 00:26:23,839
And just using the notes app, I mean like you don't need to have Jira or Trello to start, you know,
like you said, you can use a spreadsheet, you can use a Symboled note, note taking app, right?

465
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:26,779
Piece of paper, right, right back of an envelope, literal.

466
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:28,354
. 
Leo Dion (host): Right, right.

467
00:26:28,384 --> 00:26:32,704
Well, and there's something nice about that, cuz then you don't have this feeling of, oh, this is permanent.

468
00:26:32,704 --> 00:26:33,844
I need to save this.

469
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,919
Cause if it's on paper, it's like, okay, I copied it over.

470
00:26:36,924 --> 00:26:38,779
I'm done pro processing it.

471
00:26:38,852 --> 00:26:39,932
Yeah, I can throw it away.

472
00:26:40,502 --> 00:26:40,802
What?

473
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:41,120
Yeah.

474
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:43,995
One of the things you wrote down is domain driven design.

475
00:26:44,415 --> 00:26:44,655
What?

476
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:44,945
Yeah.

477
00:26:45,615 --> 00:26:46,125
What did you mean

478
00:26:46,275 --> 00:26:46,755
Tim Mitra (guest): by that, Tim?

479
00:26:46,835 --> 00:26:49,095
So, so this is, this is something, it's interesting.

480
00:26:49,155 --> 00:26:52,845
It, it came out of our work at Spot Hero, our, our previous cto.

481
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:53,955
I think he introduced the idea.

482
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,795
I'm not sure if, well, apologies to people at Spot Hero, so it wasn't his idea.

483
00:26:57,795 --> 00:26:59,342
But there's a book by O'Reilly called din.

484
00:26:59,732 --> 00:27:01,562
Domain driven design.

485
00:27:01,562 --> 00:27:10,832
And the idea behind it is one of my favorite things about it is a thing called
event storm, where you look at the business logic of your, of your process, right?

486
00:27:10,832 --> 00:27:13,142
And you kind of break it down.

487
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:20,745
You break down the, the using an event storm, you break down the
sort of processes that go into sorting out a a business thing.

488
00:27:21,045 --> 00:27:21,935
Think of a bus.

489
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,250
What would you do?

490
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,560
Like maybe a pizza delivery service or something like that?

491
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:25,890
Right.

492
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,430
Okay.

493
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:29,905
You know, so you'd have different parts of your, of your organization.

494
00:27:29,905 --> 00:27:37,075
One is, you know, there's gonna be an order taking system that's going to,
you know, describe all the orders, all the parts that make up a good pizza.

495
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:37,405
Right.

496
00:27:37,765 --> 00:27:43,435
And then you've got your, your kitchen staff that are gonna
take the, get the orders, read what kind of pizza the person.

497
00:27:44,855 --> 00:27:45,995
Somebody's gonna have to prepare the dough.

498
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:49,955
Somebody's gonna have to put all the, the, you know, the pepperoni and the cheese and the sauce on it.

499
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:53,255
Then there's the oven crew that's gonna have to put it in the oven.

500
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,685
Turn the heat, obviously heat the oven up, right?

501
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:58,175
Put the pizza in the oven to make the pizza.

502
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:05,735
There's gonna be the team that, after the pizza's been made, puts it in the box
and hands it to the driver, you know, with the order number on it, for example.

503
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,265
Then there's gonna be a cleanup.

504
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:09,485
Crew has to go in and clean the plates and clean.

505
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,730
Utensils that were used to make the dough and to make the pizza.

506
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:18,340
And then you're gonna hand it to a driver who's gonna go and, you know, put it in his car and take it to an address.

507
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,840
Well, where, how does he get to that address?

508
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,190
We need now we need, you know, an iPhone with a maps app on it to tell him where to go to deliver.

509
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:31,690
And then he gets the door, he takes a picture of the image and he,
so anyway, there's a whole complex thing to just making a pizza.

510
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:32,730
Right, right.

511
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,180
Or making a pizza app if you want.

512
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,290
Or making a pizza business.

513
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:35,590
Right.

514
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:45,070
So, What you do is you in, in the sort of the vein driven de development
is you say, okay, let's look at the making of the, the, the bakers, right?

515
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,350
The people that are actually putting the pizza together.

516
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,650
Right.

517
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,120
That's a domain.

518
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:49,960
Right?

519
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:57,220
And so you look at, we, we sit down and we examine all of the
pieces, all of the processes that go into making pizza, right?

520
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,080
Making the physical pizza itself, right?

521
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,020
Irrespective of all those other domains that I described, right?

522
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,650
And you look at that one particular domain and you go through all the sort.

523
00:29:05,717 --> 00:29:10,351
Piece the, the, the, the sequences of, of events that need to happen in order to make a pizza.

524
00:29:10,351 --> 00:29:14,341
And then we look at, well, who is the person who's gonna act on that particular thing?

525
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:18,511
Is it an automated process or is it an actual human being who needs to do this?

526
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:21,781
You know, like, can we write out, can we write up some coat that'll chop pepperoni?

527
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:22,471
I don't think so.

528
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:24,601
We need to have somebody with a knife to cut the pepperoni.

529
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:24,811
Right?

530
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:29,791
For example, I'm using a bricks and mortar kind of example for, for the sake of science, but yeah.

531
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:38,873
. So the idea is you, you kind of go through and you examine all of the sort of things that,
things, you know, traditional, maybe you have some, some traditional things you've been doing.

532
00:29:38,873 --> 00:29:46,283
So, so far, and this is the only way we can get this to work, we use the, you
know, we use a piece of paper and a pencil because that's what we have, right?

533
00:29:46,283 --> 00:29:51,183
Well, maybe we could use a piece, you know, a notes app or we
can use any spreadsheet or we can use something that's search.

534
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:57,038
, you know, like maybe down the road we might want to, you know, keep track of the orders and go back and see.

535
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:07,538
Historically, like when it comes to ordering the supplies, how do we know which are the most commonly
used pizzas or com most commonly used supplies, which do we have more, need to have more of or less of?

536
00:30:07,543 --> 00:30:07,838
Right?

537
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:20,468
So by examining the sort of domain around what is needs to get done within that particular
sphere of, of the work, you can create a design like a, I mean a design in terms of.

538
00:30:21,338 --> 00:30:22,778
The process of development.

539
00:30:22,778 --> 00:30:26,858
You can write the little APIs, you can assign this, you know, create the assignments to people.

540
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:30,698
You can create user stories to facilitate, you know, the, that thing.

541
00:30:30,698 --> 00:30:33,398
So if you think about, like, so take this back a step.

542
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:37,438
If this was, Hey, I want to write an iOS app that for ordering pizza, I.

543
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:46,883
Right now you have by examining the different, like by looking at this one particular
domain, we know what is required in that particular domain of the business, right?

544
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:51,149
And then we can look, we can go and look at, you know, the, the order takers domain.

545
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,999
We can look at the guy drive in the car domain.

546
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:57,509
We can look at the guy ordering the supplies to make the pizza.

547
00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:00,389
That's another domain that can be, can be examined.

548
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:02,759
So you look at, you break down your business into.

549
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:08,729
Different parts and you put it together, you create a plan to put it together and it's great looking.

550
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:09,869
Come, yeah, go ahead.

551
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:10,709
Well, I'm,

552
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:16,139
Leo Dion (host): what I'm hearing is a great opportunity to mo modularize your code.

553
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:23,629
Cause like just listening to your pizza analogy, I'm like, each domain has its own library attached to it.

554
00:31:23,629 --> 00:31:23,869
Right.

555
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:25,739
And like, like or each

556
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:26,349
Tim Mitra (guest): switch it might be a package.

557
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:27,549
Package, yeah, exactly.

558
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:27,949
, right.

559
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:29,879
Leo Dion (host): And it's all testing within its own.

560
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:30,419
Its.

561
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,899
set, whatever its own domain.

562
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:34,499
Yeah, yeah.

563
00:31:34,499 --> 00:31:34,799
Right.

564
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:34,979
Yeah.

565
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:48,089
As opposed to, because I, I know I've done this accidentally, and by that I mean like, I know it's, it's, it's
naturally how you kind of factor things out is like the, the making the pizza does not care about delivering the pizza.

566
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,559
It only cares about making the pizza

567
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,909
Tim Mitra (guest): and Well, that's not true.

568
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,479
That's not true.

569
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:52,779
Well, you know what I mean?

570
00:31:53,384 --> 00:32:00,884
When you, when you do your examination, you might have the drivers come and
tell you, well, you know, Leo, the pizzas are hot when they come outta the oven.

571
00:32:01,394 --> 00:32:01,604
Yeah, okay.

572
00:32:01,604 --> 00:32:02,654
I need a way to handle that.

573
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:02,924
Right.

574
00:32:02,924 --> 00:32:03,854
So like there, yeah.

575
00:32:03,884 --> 00:32:11,384
So it's, it does help to have cross domain or what we're talking, I understand where
the connection, multidisciplinary development, it pays to have those guys in the

576
00:32:11,384 --> 00:32:15,884
room to have their sort of, because maybe there's a, maybe there's a way of doing it.

577
00:32:15,884 --> 00:32:18,134
And, and if I can go back to the act shaving for a sec.

578
00:32:18,134 --> 00:32:21,584
So do you, you, do you know the story about the ACT shaving, how that comes to being.

579
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:22,544
I think

580
00:32:22,544 --> 00:32:23,834
Leo Dion (host): I've heard of it before, but I'll

581
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:24,794
Tim Mitra (guest): let you go ahead and repeat it.

582
00:32:24,794 --> 00:32:33,644
Yeah, so, so it's one of my favorite things about like, when you're developing or thinking
about a, an app, an app idea, and it's all, it's kind of like, don't reinvent the wheel, right?

583
00:32:33,644 --> 00:32:33,764
Mm-hmm.

584
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,844
, or, or you, you know, the ney, you ain't gonna need that kind of thing, right?

585
00:32:37,844 --> 00:32:37,904
Yeah.

586
00:32:37,904 --> 00:32:38,204
Right.

587
00:32:38,204 --> 00:32:38,535
The idea.

588
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:38,904
Yeah.

589
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:42,224
The idea is I want to get, I want to get Leo a gift, right?

590
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:49,724
And, and I know Leo likes, you know, he likes warm clothing cuz he lives
in the northern climate and so he, I'm gonna make him a, a yak wool.

591
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:50,864
right?

592
00:32:51,284 --> 00:32:57,144
Well, in order to make a yak, woo, it's kinda like a piece of story
I just told, but to make a yak wool sweater, I need to have some y.

593
00:32:57,929 --> 00:32:58,259
, right?

594
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,389
I also need to learn how to knit, right?

595
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:02,729
So to make a sweater for, for Leo kind of thing.

596
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:08,309
So, you know, first of all, so I gotta go and learn how to make, how to knit and develop that skill.

597
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:10,799
But in the meantime, I need to get this Yaqui.

598
00:33:10,804 --> 00:33:12,299
Well, how do I get the Yaqui?

599
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:16,529
Well, I need to go to the store that makes the get, that supplies the Yaqui.

600
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:18,659
Well, maybe there isn't a store that makes the Yaqui.

601
00:33:18,689 --> 00:33:22,409
Maybe I need to figure out how to make the Yaqui myself.

602
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:24,689
Well, then I have to go and explore how to make wool.

603
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:26,184
right?

604
00:33:26,184 --> 00:33:26,744
Mm-hmm.

605
00:33:26,824 --> 00:33:27,224
, and then mm-hmm.

606
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:35,444
, you know, how to, how to spin it, how to turn it into yarn, how to, you know, to make the sort of,
and put it onto a spool so then I can, you know, knit it with my needing and needles kind of thing.

607
00:33:35,444 --> 00:33:35,714
Right.

608
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:40,754
Well, you know, okay, so, but where do I get the supplies for the wool?

609
00:33:40,754 --> 00:33:43,394
Like the raw fiber that makes the wool right.

610
00:33:43,394 --> 00:33:46,514
While I need to go and get that from a yack, right?

611
00:33:47,054 --> 00:33:53,414
Well, so then, but then I, in order to get the, convert the yack into the yarn, I need to figure out how to shave the.

612
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,064
, right.

613
00:33:55,064 --> 00:33:59,504
And then, well, I don't have a yak here in Toronto and maybe,
I don't think you have one in Lansing, Michigan either, maybe.

614
00:33:59,564 --> 00:33:59,774
No.

615
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:03,764
So we might have to go to a zoo or might have to go to like, you know, might have to go to Tibet or something.

616
00:34:03,764 --> 00:34:05,024
I don't just, I dunno, sorry.

617
00:34:05,024 --> 00:34:16,064
Tibet, if you don't have yaks, but you have to go to Tibet and figure out how to get a yak and grow it and feed
it and, you know, make it happy and keep it well enough that it'll keep you in supply of, of yak wall or yak fur.

618
00:34:16,064 --> 00:34:16,364
Right?

619
00:34:16,414 --> 00:34:16,614
Right.

620
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:28,739
And so the idea is like, you know, rather than thinking I need you, Find, you know, find someone
who already knows how to do the act, will make the act, will get them to come and do it for you.

621
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,889
Or like, you know, don't look, look, look for swift packages.

622
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:37,649
Look for cocoa pods that do the p the part of the app that you don't need to do the heavy lifting on.

623
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:40,649
I mentioned before, don't try and write your own security, write stack?

624
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:46,829
You wanna basically use a known security stack to, to do key chain is one example of a, of a security stack, right?

625
00:34:47,364 --> 00:34:47,694
Right.

626
00:34:47,764 --> 00:34:50,164
I'm waiting for Apple to come and fix security for us.

627
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:59,520
, you know, but yeah, that, that, I think that that that the act,
the Apple story's an old computer  fable about or parable about.

628
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:00,030
Yeah.

629
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,770
You know, not trying to build it yourself, right?

630
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,670
Leo Dion (host): Yeah.

631
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,150
Yeah.

632
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,020
Exactly.

633
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:07,607
It was funny cuz before the recording we were talking about that Facebook article.

634
00:35:08,057 --> 00:35:08,177
Yeah.

635
00:35:08,177 --> 00:35:23,165
And like, if you read that article, it's like, , they built everything themselves and they, yeah, it's, they
try to, it tries to come across as victorious, but it doesn't sound sound like that's necessarily the case.

636
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:24,501
So yeah.

637
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:24,831
Yeah.

638
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,671
I totally agree.

639
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:25,941
Cool.

640
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:31,232
So before we close out, I wanted to talk about Apple rumors and history.

641
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:31,352
Mm.

642
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:39,872
Because we've, , we've been hearing a lot of rumors about a new, new piece of hardware, which, let me see.

643
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:40,112
Well,

644
00:35:40,112 --> 00:35:45,752
Tim Mitra (guest): we, we always, I want to correct you and say we,
every year we hear about a new piece of hardware that's coming, right?

645
00:35:45,972 --> 00:35:46,502
Yeah, that's true.

646
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:49,952
We're still waiting for the, the 16 gigabyte white apple car, right?

647
00:35:50,372 --> 00:35:50,642
Yeah,

648
00:35:50,642 --> 00:35:51,152
Leo Dion (host): that's right.

649
00:35:51,157 --> 00:35:51,602
That's right.

650
00:35:51,602 --> 00:35:57,812
This might, so this might be out if it, if it's out after it's been announced, which is mm-hmm.

651
00:35:57,892 --> 00:35:58,652
is a possibility.

652
00:35:58,652 --> 00:36:00,362
We won't have to cut this part, but we'll see.

653
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,242
Tim Mitra (guest): so it won't be out.

654
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:04,142
It won't be out in March.

655
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:04,652
Trust me.

656
00:36:05,222 --> 00:36:05,372
You

657
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:05,882
Leo Dion (host): don't think so?

658
00:36:06,212 --> 00:36:07,022
No, I don't think so.

659
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,642
You don't think it's gonna be the March event thing?

660
00:36:08,672 --> 00:36:08,972
Okay.

661
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:09,302
Tim Mitra (guest): No.

662
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:10,832
It sounds like a WW d c thing.

663
00:36:10,832 --> 00:36:14,612
I was listening to Jim, Jim Del Rumpel and Dave Mark talk about it on their show the other day.

664
00:36:14,612 --> 00:36:15,512
I think that was a good call.

665
00:36:15,512 --> 00:36:17,812
It's probably gonna be a WW C thing and the whole over.

666
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:21,407
I was talking to Daniel Steinberg on, on na on about it.

667
00:36:21,407 --> 00:36:26,717
It's, it sound, I, it's probably gonna be like the central theme of Wwc wwdc, right?

668
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,717
This year it's gonna be all about this, this device we're talking about.

669
00:36:29,722 --> 00:36:30,017
Right?

670
00:36:30,077 --> 00:36:31,787
Leo Dion (host): We're all gonna be using reality kit.

671
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:32,055
Yeah.

672
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:35,745
So I don't Did you listen to ATP at all?

673
00:36:35,775 --> 00:36:36,665
Tim Mitra (guest): I didn't, no, I didn't.

674
00:36:36,665 --> 00:36:41,715
I, I listened to it a couple of weeks ago when they talked about M one
s, but I haven't listened or Mastodon, but I haven't listened since.

675
00:36:42,295 --> 00:36:42,785
Leo Dion (host): Okay.

676
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:43,105
Okay.

677
00:36:43,275 --> 00:36:45,345
Yeah, I mean, they, they did a pretty good job.

678
00:36:46,365 --> 00:36:50,235
talking about how rumors and new platforms typically go.

679
00:36:50,505 --> 00:36:50,595
Mm-hmm.

680
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:56,890
and the story with the iPad, the story with the Apple Watch, and
like how it was rumored and what the market was at that time.

681
00:36:56,898 --> 00:36:58,453
I thought they did a, did a great job.

682
00:36:58,613 --> 00:36:59,223
Mm-hmm.

683
00:36:59,288 --> 00:37:03,198
Kind of talking about how these XR glasses are gonna fit into it.

684
00:37:03,198 --> 00:37:07,378
Pro reality, reality pro deluxe max.com.

685
00:37:07,398 --> 00:37:08,118
, but like Ultra.

686
00:37:08,688 --> 00:37:09,288
You've got Ultra.

687
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:09,498
Ultra, yeah.

688
00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:10,638
Sorry, I forgot about the new one.

689
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:11,208
Ultra.

690
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:12,438
They still haven't done Deluxe.

691
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,488
I'm waiting for deluxe.

692
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:14,658
Tim Mitra (guest): Looking forward to that.

693
00:37:14,658 --> 00:37:16,128
I don't think Apple does Deluxe.

694
00:37:16,578 --> 00:37:17,478
They don't do Deluxe.

695
00:37:17,508 --> 00:37:17,748
Leo Dion (host): Okay.

696
00:37:17,748 --> 00:37:19,968
No, no, not yet.

697
00:37:20,043 --> 00:37:20,853
Never say never.

698
00:37:20,858 --> 00:37:21,136
Right.

699
00:37:21,136 --> 00:37:21,437
Yeah.

700
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:23,437
. So we, yeah.

701
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:28,327
I mean, it seems to, we, we talked about this on, on more than just code.

702
00:37:28,427 --> 00:37:28,917
Yeah.

703
00:37:29,197 --> 00:37:33,427
But my big whole thing was like, I don't see the market for it, especially where Apple is at.

704
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:33,997
Yeah.

705
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,695
Especially with games and bus business being the two.

706
00:37:37,985 --> 00:37:43,055
, they want to do Microsoft teams with VR or they want to do games with vr.

707
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:43,145
Mm-hmm.

708
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:43,312
Right.

709
00:37:43,402 --> 00:37:50,495
Apple's not very good at either of those markets and it's kind of
troubling trying to figure out where they're trying to position this.

710
00:37:50,496 --> 00:37:51,306
Well, yeah.

711
00:37:51,306 --> 00:37:52,746
What do, what's kind of your thoughts on, well,

712
00:37:52,746 --> 00:37:54,726
Tim Mitra (guest): I want to take part a couple of things you said there, right?

713
00:37:54,756 --> 00:38:00,336
What one thing about Apple not being very good at any, you an insert thing here, right?

714
00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:00,876
Yeah.

715
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:07,672
And we talked about this on more than just code many, many times, but I honestly believe Apple leads from behind, right?

716
00:38:08,392 --> 00:38:08,842
Apple.

717
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:11,452
If you think about it, think about it for a minute, right?

718
00:38:11,482 --> 00:38:13,522
Apple has done some amazing things.

719
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:18,802
They've, they've turned the world on its ear with the iPhone, the iPod, you know, all kinds of different things.

720
00:38:19,402 --> 00:38:23,502
But Apple, generally speaking, Innovate.

721
00:38:23,722 --> 00:38:28,642
I mean, they innovate, but they didn't innovate the idea of something every single time.

722
00:38:28,732 --> 00:38:29,122
Right?

723
00:38:29,212 --> 00:38:30,262
They're never the first.

724
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:30,862
Leo Dion (host): They're never

725
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:31,252
Tim Mitra (guest): the first.

726
00:38:31,252 --> 00:38:34,852
They're never the first, but they're generally one, one of the best, if not the best.

727
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:35,182
Right.

728
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:38,952
Because they take the time to look at something.

729
00:38:39,957 --> 00:38:42,297
work out all the sort of kinks that they can see.

730
00:38:42,297 --> 00:38:51,057
I mean, there's obviously, there's always loose ends and there's always kinks and there's always gonna be
like, you know, 10% or 20% of society's not gonna be happy with what they've done, but, or think it's too

731
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:51,627
Leo Dion (host): expensive.

732
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:52,137
Tim Mitra (guest): But, yeah.

733
00:38:52,437 --> 00:38:53,217
Well, yeah.

734
00:38:53,517 --> 00:38:57,087
Given, given it's too expensive, you know, he said the guy with the ultra watch on, right.

735
00:38:57,662 --> 00:38:59,523
But you, but but.

736
00:39:00,978 --> 00:39:01,881
, you know yeah.

737
00:39:01,911 --> 00:39:08,811
You, you, they, they, they take an idea and they, you know, and
it's been this like, you know, from the Apple two computer, right?

738
00:39:09,351 --> 00:39:13,911
Was something that Steve Wazniak saw in home brew and saw in the world.

739
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:18,621
He didn't invent the, the portable computer, but he invented the portable computer, right?

740
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:20,241
And then you got the Mac.

741
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:30,121
Well, the Mac was not it was innovative as a package and it was innovative from
a concept of the bicycle for the mind, but it was all Xerox park's work, right?

742
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:33,361
So it was, so it was Windows, windows, the menu and all that kind of stuff.

743
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:35,191
All that desktop metaphor.

744
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:35,761
That was all.

745
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:37,861
That all came from Xerox Park, right?

746
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:39,361
Then you get into iPod.

747
00:39:39,366 --> 00:39:49,596
Well, iPod was a reaction to all the MP3 players that were out there that, you know,
Tearing up the market back in, in like, was that the nineties, early nineties, mid nineties?

748
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:49,626
Mm.

749
00:39:49,926 --> 00:39:50,706
Leo Dion (host): No, not even.

750
00:39:50,706 --> 00:39:51,816
I would say early aughts.

751
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:52,716
Tim Mitra (guest): Yes.

752
00:39:52,926 --> 00:39:54,936
Oh, 2000.

753
00:39:55,536 --> 00:39:58,206
So, I mean, so, so they, so Apple didn't invent.

754
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:06,621
MP3 players, but they, they entered the iPod, which was sort of their take on a better, a better MP3 player.

755
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:06,831
Right.

756
00:40:06,831 --> 00:40:13,521
And then they, they, the little nanos and the shuffles, they,
that was to sort of squash all the other MP3 players out there.

757
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:14,691
So that was cool.

758
00:40:14,691 --> 00:40:14,871
Right.

759
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:18,951
And then that went along great and, and iPod was doing pretty cool.

760
00:40:18,956 --> 00:40:22,461
And it wasn't until they bought another piece of software, I'm trying to remember the name of havoc.

761
00:40:23,646 --> 00:40:24,816
Snap NP or something like that.

762
00:40:24,816 --> 00:40:29,316
I forget what it was, but it actually, it actually was an app that ran on your Mac sound.

763
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,686
I've, I've got it behind me.

764
00:40:31,686 --> 00:40:33,336
I'm just, so, I'm just, you're talking about iTunes?

765
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:35,646
No, well, it became iTunes.

766
00:40:35,716 --> 00:40:36,366
Right, right, right.

767
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:36,846
That's what I meant.

768
00:40:36,846 --> 00:40:37,116
Yeah.

769
00:40:37,446 --> 00:40:37,626
Yeah.

770
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:45,639
So they bought, they acquired this company that had built this software
that let you rip your C, your C your CD music into, into MP3s, right?

771
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:46,079
Mm-hmm.

772
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:46,239
. Okay.

773
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,409
And then feed them onto your thing.

774
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:50,049
So they, so iTunes became a way to create.

775
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:55,269
MP3s that you can put on and man eventually manage your, your iPods.

776
00:40:55,299 --> 00:41:01,689
And it wasn't until Apple rolled that iTunes out onto Windows that the iPod really took off.

777
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:03,079
Yes, yes.

778
00:41:03,084 --> 00:41:03,369
Right.

779
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:09,939
Because we talked about the other day that, you know, 5% of the market
is Apple, the rest is Windows, or most of his windows, 85% is Windows.

780
00:41:09,939 --> 00:41:10,179
Right.

781
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:10,719
So that's mm-hmm.

782
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:10,760
, so that's mm-hmm.

783
00:41:11,049 --> 00:41:11,769
a huge market.

784
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,569
It's kinda like I was talking about China earlier, right?

785
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:14,559
Yeah, yeah.

786
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:14,560
Yeah.

787
00:41:15,189 --> 00:41:17,199
. So that was what put the iPod on the map.

788
00:41:17,229 --> 00:41:19,059
Now all of a sudden everybody had an iPad.

789
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:19,569
It didn't matter.

790
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:20,949
Or sorry, iPod.

791
00:41:20,954 --> 00:41:21,219
iPod.

792
00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:21,519
Correct.

793
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:22,059
You correct me.

794
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:22,299
Yeah.

795
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:24,639
Everybody had an iPod, you know.

796
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:29,167
And and that sort of, you know, and then the next thing next, I remember driving to McElroy.

797
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:34,567
I was told this story a thousand times with my wife to down to San
Francisco, and she says like, what do you think the new thing is gonna be?

798
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:40,027
And I think, well, I've been hearing rumors of a phone, but I have no idea what Apple's gonna do with a cell phone.

799
00:41:40,027 --> 00:41:41,017
Like, why bother?

800
00:41:41,017 --> 00:41:41,887
They're making a cell phone.

801
00:41:42,697 --> 00:41:42,907
Right.

802
00:41:42,907 --> 00:41:43,897
And then it turned out well.

803
00:41:43,897 --> 00:41:44,107
Okay.

804
00:41:44,107 --> 00:41:48,547
It's not just a cell phone, it's a phone, it's an HomePod, it's, you know, or it's an iPod.

805
00:41:48,552 --> 00:41:50,257
And it's an iPod and it's an internet device, right.

806
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:52,117
As as the famous, the classic, the

807
00:41:52,117 --> 00:41:52,807
Leo Dion (host): classic three

808
00:41:52,807 --> 00:41:53,167
Tim Mitra (guest): things.

809
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:53,467
Yes.

810
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:54,337
Yeah, the three things.

811
00:41:54,337 --> 00:41:54,577
One more.

812
00:41:54,577 --> 00:41:55,207
Yeah, one more thing.

813
00:41:55,207 --> 00:42:01,927
And there's three things and one more thing, but you know, so that, that became the, that sort of tipped apple on it.

814
00:42:01,927 --> 00:42:10,927
I mean, so as you go through every sort of thing that, think about anything that apple's
done other than Apple silicone, well, apple silicone was kind of like AMD's technology.

815
00:42:11,587 --> 00:42:14,287
Is it AMD that makes the, the arm.

816
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:15,907
Arm, sorry, arm.

817
00:42:15,907 --> 00:42:16,447
That's what I'm thinking of.

818
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,017
Thank you Arm.

819
00:42:17,027 --> 00:42:17,267
Mm-hmm.

820
00:42:17,347 --> 00:42:18,457
, it's arm technology.

821
00:42:18,457 --> 00:42:18,757
Right?

822
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:24,007
And, and even the multi-touch device that we have on our iPhones
and our iPads, that was invented by somebody else as well, right?

823
00:42:24,007 --> 00:42:24,067
Yeah.

824
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:28,417
So Apple's good at putting together a synergy of, of.

825
00:42:28,822 --> 00:42:32,362
Ideas in such a way that it makes sense to the majority of people.

826
00:42:32,632 --> 00:42:37,582
It improves the quality of their life, which is why people buy apple, mu apple stuff.

827
00:42:37,882 --> 00:42:41,572
They don't buy the gigahertz, they don't buy the megawatts, you know, they buy very much.

828
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:44,302
So yeah, this makes me feel good, right?

829
00:42:44,512 --> 00:42:44,752
Yeah.

830
00:42:44,932 --> 00:42:50,842
And, and Apple cares about me feeling good and looking good with
my ultra watch on my wrist, which just looks really sexy, right?

831
00:42:50,842 --> 00:42:51,592
It does look good.

832
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:56,823
, 
Leo Dion (host): I just upgraded speaking with, I just upgraded to a series seven from a series.

833
00:42:57,163 --> 00:42:58,443
Six, I think.

834
00:42:58,683 --> 00:42:58,983
Yeah.

835
00:42:59,073 --> 00:43:03,943
And the watch size, I'm just like, oh my gosh, I can't, because I went from 40 to 45.

836
00:43:03,943 --> 00:43:04,803
Oh, the smaller size to the bigger one.

837
00:43:04,803 --> 00:43:05,193
Yeah.

838
00:43:05,403 --> 00:43:05,793
Yeah.

839
00:43:05,793 --> 00:43:08,673
And I'm like, I couldn't even imagine going into an ultra.

840
00:43:08,678 --> 00:43:08,943
So

841
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,473
Tim Mitra (guest): it's actually not that much bigger.

842
00:43:10,473 --> 00:43:11,043
It's thicker.

843
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:12,273
It's heavier, right.

844
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:15,033
It's, I mean, it's thicker this way than, but, and it is.

845
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:15,453
It is.

846
00:43:15,513 --> 00:43:15,843
It is.

847
00:43:15,873 --> 00:43:24,093
It took a while for my wrist to get used to it, but physically, like size-wise,
what I love about this is, for me, I'm almost nervous about cracking the edge of.

848
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,813
my phone on the, on a brick as I walk through a doorway.

849
00:43:27,843 --> 00:43:28,023
Right.

850
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:29,973
Well this has got like a titan, titanium ridge all over.

851
00:43:29,973 --> 00:43:30,633
That's one of my watches.

852
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:31,293
Yeah.

853
00:43:31,293 --> 00:43:35,043
And for me, the big, the big selling point for me is the one button to get activities going.

854
00:43:35,943 --> 00:43:37,113
Oh, you know, nice.

855
00:43:37,113 --> 00:43:39,303
The activity button where I think it's called that.

856
00:43:39,313 --> 00:43:39,873
Leo Dion (host): Yeah, yeah, yeah.

857
00:43:39,873 --> 00:43:41,223
No, I know exactly what you mean.

858
00:43:41,316 --> 00:43:41,436
I'm

859
00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:45,876
Tim Mitra (guest): not a huge, I'm, to be honest with you, I wear a watch every day, but, but watch is not my thing.

860
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:48,156
I mean, the watch os was a real disappointment.

861
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:51,546
Watch os 1.0 was a real disappointment.

862
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:51,846
Right.

863
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:52,761
Yeah.

864
00:43:52,898 --> 00:43:57,038
Leo Dion (host): Going back, talking about the headset, like okay, like the, the

865
00:43:57,038 --> 00:43:58,688
Tim Mitra (guest): one thing that, so we're talking about VR goggles.

866
00:43:58,688 --> 00:44:00,218
I don't think we've actually said that to people.

867
00:44:00,218 --> 00:44:03,548
We're talking about the VR sort of a reality.

868
00:44:03,548 --> 00:44:07,038
Reality vr, that's what we be called vr, just wanna be clear with people.

869
00:44:07,106 --> 00:44:11,156
. Leo Dion (host): So one of the points I made on ATP was that like, and we're talking about these guys

870
00:44:11,156 --> 00:44:13,466
Tim Mitra (guest): here, the a augmented reality device.

871
00:44:13,616 --> 00:44:14,156
Leo Dion (host): Exactly.

872
00:44:14,156 --> 00:44:15,596
They look exactly like that.

873
00:44:15,596 --> 00:44:15,806
Tim Mitra (guest): Yeah.

874
00:44:16,016 --> 00:44:17,456
It's gonna be exactly this.

875
00:44:17,486 --> 00:44:17,666
Yeah.

876
00:44:17,966 --> 00:44:18,116
The

877
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:22,671
Leo Dion (host): one thing they said was like, multitouch was a big killer feature of the iPhone.

878
00:44:22,711 --> 00:44:22,861
Yeah.

879
00:44:22,891 --> 00:44:26,551
That made it more like, okay, now I see why this is such a

880
00:44:26,551 --> 00:44:26,791
Tim Mitra (guest): big deal.

881
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:29,450
Also, the biggest downfall, cuz, I mean, have you ever tried to type on an.

882
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:29,789
? 

Yeah.

883
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:34,499
Why ? Well, cuz I mean, like, why did they have to make a, a keyboard for it if it was so good?

884
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:36,539
, like, I have Right.

885
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:38,849
You know, I have the magic keyboard here and I

886
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:39,269
Leo Dion (host): love it.

887
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:40,019
Well, I miss that.

888
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:41,399
I mean, I miss tactile.

889
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:44,939
I mean, there is benefits to how Blackberry did it, but it Yeah.

890
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:46,399
Tim Mitra (guest): In any case, I don't know.

891
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:49,799
It's good and bad.

892
00:44:49,799 --> 00:44:51,029
I mean, I, I, you know, I right.

893
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:51,379
Yeah.

894
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:51,789
Well,

895
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,359
Leo Dion (host): and, but I think that's the thing is like the.

896
00:44:54,199 --> 00:45:03,479
, even with multitouch and losing a physical keyboard, like they way
overcame with the snappiness and, and the great, the, the great ux.

897
00:45:03,523 --> 00:45:04,233
Lately the auto,

898
00:45:04,233 --> 00:45:05,233
Tim Mitra (guest): you see that is awful.

899
00:45:05,923 --> 00:45:07,273
What's that said lately?

900
00:45:07,278 --> 00:45:08,353
The autocorrect is awful.

901
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:10,303
Like it's just, it's just lost its mind.

902
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:15,613
I wish it was a way to reset your, your library of auto, of your auto complete nonsense,

903
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:15,883
Leo Dion (host): right?

904
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:16,153
Yeah.

905
00:45:16,153 --> 00:45:16,423
Yes.

906
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:17,023
Exactly.

907
00:45:17,023 --> 00:45:17,683
Exactly.

908
00:45:17,704 --> 00:45:20,329
But like even with like the dynamic island, like.

909
00:45:21,274 --> 00:45:25,894
I didn't buy a new iPhone, but it's like impressive how apple's like, oh, you did okay.

910
00:45:25,894 --> 00:45:27,844
But you're like, you saw that presentation.

911
00:45:27,844 --> 00:45:32,734
You're like, oh, apple always comes up with some clever workaround for some physical.

912
00:45:32,854 --> 00:45:35,764
Tim Mitra (guest): Well, can I tell you about some of the problems with the dynamic island?

913
00:45:36,274 --> 00:45:37,114
Leo Dion (host): Not, not yet.

914
00:45:37,144 --> 00:45:38,614
I wanna, I want to go back to the headset.

915
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:40,105
I wanna go back to the headset.

916
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:40,399
But

917
00:45:40,399 --> 00:45:43,879
Tim Mitra (guest): like my recommendations, don't buy more than one headset, 1.0.

918
00:45:45,484 --> 00:45:46,264
. 
Leo Dion (host): Yeah, right.

919
00:45:46,264 --> 00:45:48,299
We'll, going back to the Apple Watch or the home phone.

920
00:45:48,299 --> 00:45:48,389
Well,

921
00:45:48,389 --> 00:45:49,259
Tim Mitra (guest): no, not so much that.

922
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:49,979
Yeah.

923
00:45:49,979 --> 00:45:51,929
It comes back to, we'll get to my point in a minute.

924
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:52,469
Sorry.

925
00:45:52,529 --> 00:45:52,763
Continue.

926
00:45:52,780 --> 00:46:00,050
Leo Dion (host): But like, do you think that there, what, what could possibly
be like a killer feature that would make these more substantial that than like

927
00:46:00,154 --> 00:46:08,554
Then the current sets of VR headsets mean because like I had, I had
like, I had this Windows Mobile smartphone before the iPhone came out.

928
00:46:08,554 --> 00:46:12,754
And like my Windows Mobile, I'm not talking the one that was actually half decent looking.

929
00:46:12,754 --> 00:46:16,504
I'm talking like basically was Windows 98 on a phone?

930
00:46:16,864 --> 00:46:17,584
It was garbage.

931
00:46:17,589 --> 00:46:18,484
You had to have I remember those.

932
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:18,694
Yeah.

933
00:46:18,934 --> 00:46:22,324
And then people who are like, oh, how are they gonna make the iPhone any better than this?

934
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:23,524
And then they like totally.

935
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:38,249
And like to me, like that's, that's the only thing I could see is like, they have something that is going to be
like, we're gonna look back and be like, oh my gosh, the ocul Oculus is so old and like, it's so janky and like Apple

936
00:46:38,249 --> 00:46:38,819
Tim Mitra (guest): totally new.

937
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:40,049
It doesn't even come in titanium.

938
00:46:40,049 --> 00:46:40,559
Exactly.

939
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:40,829
Yeah.

940
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,159
Leo Dion (host): with the, with the orange button on the side, right?

941
00:46:44,249 --> 00:46:44,459
Yeah.

942
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:49,082
What could be the thing that like, like Apple could do with these that's, it's gonna be.

943
00:46:49,717 --> 00:46:50,377
Oh, that's it.

944
00:46:50,437 --> 00:46:51,457
Now I, Andrew, get it.

945
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,377
Like, what could I, I can't even think of it.

946
00:46:54,337 --> 00:46:57,157
. 
Tim Mitra (guest): Well, I mean, we talked about that the other day too, is, is the watch.

947
00:46:57,217 --> 00:47:01,387
You know, initially the watch was not a fitness device, but it is a fitness device.

948
00:47:01,387 --> 00:47:06,247
I mean, it's totally like I bought, I bought the four because of the EKG again, when I talked about the gray hair.

949
00:47:06,247 --> 00:47:06,547
Right.

950
00:47:06,637 --> 00:47:08,527
You know, the EKGs important to me, right?

951
00:47:08,532 --> 00:47:08,967
Yeah.

952
00:47:08,967 --> 00:47:08,968
Yeah.

953
00:47:09,056 --> 00:47:10,736
Blood is an important thing.

954
00:47:10,966 --> 00:47:15,376
Not so much to me, but like the last couple of years, people getting covid blood was a huge thing.

955
00:47:15,376 --> 00:47:16,346
Right, right.

956
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:23,893
Blood oxygen levels, but, or, you know I, I'm not a lady so I really
can't speak to cycle tracking, but I'm sure that's an important thing.

957
00:47:23,893 --> 00:47:23,983
Right.

958
00:47:23,983 --> 00:47:32,713
I mean, I've, I've tried to get, I've tried to get my wife pregnant and
that was a chore, you know, with, with thermometers and log books and yeah.

959
00:47:32,713 --> 00:47:35,023
I mean, please solve that problem for me.

960
00:47:35,023 --> 00:47:36,133
Apple, thank you very much.

961
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:37,504
Right, ? I think, I think that you.

962
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:43,796
Again, I think we also agreed to agree that we are not the target market for this product.

963
00:47:43,796 --> 00:47:51,258
You and I, but but I, I don't know, like, I think I, I riffed on the idea of, of maybe, you know, heads up navigation.

964
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:55,261
You know, golf maybe tells you how far the hole is from your, from your putt, right?

965
00:47:55,261 --> 00:47:56,458
Or your, or your shot.

966
00:47:56,458 --> 00:48:08,153
Maybe it's used, you know, can be used in, in industry where, you know, like warehouse management or, I think
I, I remember seeing an early I ar example back in the early days of the iPhone where you held up your camera.

967
00:48:08,878 --> 00:48:10,918
I think it was like Yelp, right?

968
00:48:10,918 --> 00:48:17,998
And it showed like you could hold it up and move it around like this and it would show you like,
okay, there's a pizza restaurant over there and there's an Italian restaurant over there and yeah.

969
00:48:18,003 --> 00:48:18,088
Yeah.

970
00:48:18,088 --> 00:48:24,868
And as you sort of, it sort of figured out where you were pointing based
on the G P s, what was in front of you, maybe that's something to do.

971
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:25,228
Heads up.

972
00:48:25,843 --> 00:48:32,092
, maybe it's heads, maybe it's like hey, you know, you're reading your
text messages, there's a telephone pole you're walking into, right?

973
00:48:32,092 --> 00:48:36,382
Like, like maybe it's, maybe it's heads up navigation for pedestrians or bike rider.

974
00:48:36,472 --> 00:48:39,022
Maybe you're riding a bike and it gives you like a heads up display, right?

975
00:48:39,462 --> 00:48:40,152
That's true.

976
00:48:40,163 --> 00:48:46,806
Or maybe, yeah, I mean, or like in the gaming thing, maybe you can play like Red Dead redemption as if you're.

977
00:48:47,631 --> 00:48:49,461
The actual environment of that world.

978
00:48:49,461 --> 00:48:51,681
I mean, I dunno if you've ever seen the world, but it's huge.

979
00:48:51,681 --> 00:48:56,601
Like, it goes on, like, you know, it takes you 20 minutes to go from one town to the other, riding a horse.

980
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,181
I mean, it literally, like, it does that, you know?

981
00:48:59,751 --> 00:48:59,811
Yeah.

982
00:48:59,816 --> 00:49:04,114
So, I mean, from a gaming point of view, I think there's, there's, there's opportunities there.

983
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:04,681
Heads up.

984
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:17,617
I mean, like maybe a doctor could be wearing it and just sort of like, look at you and maybe he put some sensors on you
and he can just look at you and see that your heart's like,  properly working or, or your blood ox is not good or Right.

985
00:49:17,617 --> 00:49:22,717
I mean, I'm thinking, I can think of any number of ways that, that AR and VR could be used.

986
00:49:22,717 --> 00:49:26,137
I mean, I, I think, joked with you about the fact that people were having relations.

987
00:49:26,707 --> 00:49:28,657
Using VR back in the early days.

988
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:30,147
Right, right, right, right.

989
00:49:30,152 --> 00:49:33,387
Devices that you could, wearable devices that would stimulate whatever.

990
00:49:33,392 --> 00:49:33,487
Yeah.

991
00:49:34,297 --> 00:49:34,537
Yeah.

992
00:49:34,537 --> 00:49:43,135
I mean, so, so where, I mean, architectural engineering, I can think
of tons of different ways that, that it'll, it'll improve things.

993
00:49:43,135 --> 00:49:48,685
I mean, I don't know whether it'll take a long time before the law
lets us do it, but maybe you wear the headset when you're driving.

994
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:49,615
Right, right.

995
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:53,665
Maybe, maybe it puts your speed in your, and, you know, things right in front of me.

996
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:55,785
My concern about it is like the whole.

997
00:49:56,665 --> 00:50:05,245
and like I was telling you about my, my, my nephew's place, they had to move all the furniture
out of the way when they had the Oculus on because you're gonna hurt yourself, right?

998
00:50:05,605 --> 00:50:05,842
Yeah.

999
00:50:05,842 --> 00:50:06,779
My concern is when

1000
00:50:06,779 --> 00:50:09,299
Leo Dion (host): you're out, but then you have crash detection on your Apple Watch.

1001
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:11,009
So, but that's

1002
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:11,529
Tim Mitra (guest): after the fact.

1003
00:50:12,404 --> 00:50:16,484
You, it's too, I think it's already too late to prevent the accident if you've already had it.

1004
00:50:16,484 --> 00:50:16,694
Right.

1005
00:50:19,034 --> 00:50:30,611
, you know, or, but, but, but then again, like we also talked about, you know, may, maybe it's an experiential thing,
maybe you know, Trevor Noah at the, at the Grammy Award is wearing a Grammy's just happened this weekend, but he's

1006
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:36,041
wearing a headset that lets you go and have a conversation with Beyonce as if you're in the room with Beyonce.

1007
00:50:36,071 --> 00:50:36,341
Right.

1008
00:50:36,386 --> 00:50:36,476
Right.

1009
00:50:36,806 --> 00:50:47,516
Maybe it, maybe it's concerts like now, instead of going to a physical concert to see a band
play, you know, you can actually experience that through a VR like you put on the headset.

1010
00:50:47,546 --> 00:50:51,116
Now you're in, you know, you're in the stadium, you're, you know, with all the other.

1011
00:50:51,476 --> 00:50:54,686
Avatars, you know all the emojis in the audience, right?

1012
00:50:54,686 --> 00:50:55,016
Yeah, yeah.

1013
00:50:55,021 --> 00:50:57,236
Instead of having audience members, it'll be all emojis.

1014
00:50:57,241 --> 00:51:05,696
You right Mark is wrong about importance of emojis, but you know,
maybe that may, maybe we all, maybe we all attend WWE Z this way.

1015
00:51:05,696 --> 00:51:07,706
Maybe they're gonna have a developer kit and they'll ship.

1016
00:51:07,711 --> 00:51:08,366
That would make total

1017
00:51:08,366 --> 00:51:09,926
Leo Dion (host): sense as if they do that.

1018
00:51:10,006 --> 00:51:10,496
Yeah.

1019
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:12,986
Like especially if you think they're gonna announce it in June that.

1020
00:51:13,381 --> 00:51:13,771
That would,

1021
00:51:14,011 --> 00:51:19,681
Tim Mitra (guest): well, I mean, I mean, June, I can tell you
