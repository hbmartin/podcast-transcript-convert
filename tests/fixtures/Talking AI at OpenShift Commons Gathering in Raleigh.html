<p>Now for something completely different. Frank is in Raleigh speaking at</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:04</time>
<p>OpenShift Commons gathering. In this livestream,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:07</time>
<p>we see Frank dressed in his dapper suit and his streaming</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:11</time>
<p>skills put to the test. Frank has quite the</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:14</time>
<p>agenda with a demo to deliver, a panel to moderate, and a</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:18</time>
<p>sneaky plan to snag some unsuspecting interviewees.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:22</time>
<p>We're certainly in for a treat.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:29</time>
<p>Hello. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:32</time>
<p>Depending on where where you are on the planet. My name</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:36</time>
<p>is Frank Lavinia. And before the</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:39</time>
<p>captions, which I can't seem to there we</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:43</time>
<p>go. My name is Frank Lavinia,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:46</time>
<p>and I am streaming live,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:51</time>
<p>from OpenShift Commons in Raleigh. We</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:54</time>
<p>haven't started yet. Beautiful venue at</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:00:58</time>
<p>Raleigh. About a block Block and a half from the Red</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:02</time>
<p>Hat headquarters. They call it the tower, because it's a</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:06</time>
<p>tall office building. And, Raleigh's a cool city with a</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:09</time>
<p>cool little downtown, and</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:13</time>
<p>you see kind of the Little city market</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:17</time>
<p>type thing going on. This apparently used to be a big, little,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:21</time>
<p>big, little, market hall. Now it's an</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:24</time>
<p>event space. And, as I walk through</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:28</time>
<p>here, you can kind of appreciate the architecture.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:31</time>
<p>So This is my 1st OpenShift commons</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:35</time>
<p>gathering. Relatively speaking, I'm kinda new</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:39</time>
<p>to the, open source community.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:45</time>
<p>And, yeah, I'm really looking forward to this.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:48</time>
<p>First one, I'm actually gonna be 1st, delivering a demo</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:52</time>
<p>and then moderating a panel, and then maybe I can sneak away</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:01:56</time>
<p>and get some people to kinda talk on, on camera.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:00</time>
<p>And then if, there's the nice,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:04</time>
<p>registration booth. I think it's gonna start up in, like, half an</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:08</time>
<p>hour. And, here's kind of</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:11</time>
<p>the the main park in Raleigh.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:15</time>
<p>Oh, there's an IMAX there.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:19</time>
<p>And there's a children's museum and stuff. One of these days, they come back down</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:23</time>
<p>with the kids. Every time I've been to Raleigh, it's for work. Actually,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:27</time>
<p>Two times it's been for Holly. This</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:30</time>
<p>time this time, I,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:34</time>
<p>I drove down, because last time I was here, I guess, like, a JFK</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:38</time>
<p>for, like, 8 hours. And JFK</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:42</time>
<p>Airport is not my favorite airport at all. Just I'll just drop that there.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:47</time>
<p>And it's actually a 5 hour drive. 4 and a half, 5 hour drive,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:51</time>
<p>from from where I live. So I was like, you know what? Plus,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:55</time>
<p>I had a lot of, a lot of craziness. A lot of commitments going on</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:02:58</time>
<p>in, in Chateau, Lavinia.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:03</time>
<p>But, Yeah. It's it's been good.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:08</time>
<p>We're basically doing kind of planning meetings. Got to meet a lot of people in</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:11</time>
<p>person, that I have only seen online. So</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:15</time>
<p>that's always good. I'm gonna catch up with my manager today.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:18</time>
<p>So I'm gonna be, like I said, monitoring a panel</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:22</time>
<p>On AI open source. And I think it's really you</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:26</time>
<p>know, most people who follow me here,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:30</time>
<p>are probably in the strongly in the Microsoft ecosystem. And a lot</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:34</time>
<p>of people, they say, Frank, what happened to you? You're not You got a lot</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:37</time>
<p>of Microsoft centric stuff anymore. And I said that's not true. You just don't see</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:40</time>
<p>it. I am still a Microsoft AI MVP.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:44</time>
<p>I have access to a lot of the cool toys, I presented at a</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:48</time>
<p>community event in Ruston, with the OpenAI, day,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:53</time>
<p>back in August. Some silver and plug in to that community.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:03:56</time>
<p>It's just that open source,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:03</time>
<p>AI is open source dominates the AI. Right? If you look at</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:06</time>
<p>it all up, by and large, it is primarily an open</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:10</time>
<p>source story. And I apologize for the camera shaking, but</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:14</time>
<p>I couldn't, didn't have time to practice with</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:17</time>
<p>my stable self stabilizing, selfie stick.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:21</time>
<p>So I figured I'd just do it the old fashioned way.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:26</time>
<p>But open source is really dominating this field. And I</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:30</time>
<p>think that's by and large a good thing. It's not a great thing. And</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:34</time>
<p>part of that is is just the transparency, the openness,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:38</time>
<p>and the, community driven</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:42</time>
<p>nature of it is, 1, not only is the power of innovation, but I</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:46</time>
<p>think it also engenders a lot more trust in, say, a closed source</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:49</time>
<p>system. Elon Musk is, clearly has more money than</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:53</time>
<p>me. Arguably, he might have better sense of humor than</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:04:56</time>
<p>me, But he has commented on how OpenAI</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:01</time>
<p>isn't, was a nonprofit that was dedicated to openness. And now</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:05</time>
<p>it's really neither. Now whatever you think of him,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:09</time>
<p>you know, that doesn't change the fact that there's a kernel of truth</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:12</time>
<p>there. And when I say kernel, right, when I when I first</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:16</time>
<p>joined Red Hat, a lot of my former Microsoft colleagues, they were like, why are</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:20</time>
<p>you leaving? What you were doing? Writing a little phone code? No. No. No. No.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:23</time>
<p>No. No. No. I'm still working on AI. They I think some of</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:27</time>
<p>them actually wanted to schedule an intervention.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:32</time>
<p>To make sure hey. I got my first comment. And this is the part where</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:35</time>
<p>I don't need my glasses. And it's my brother from another</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:39</time>
<p>mother. Am I causing trouble?</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:44</time>
<p>Not yet. Still kinda early. Go for the bow tie.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:48</time>
<p>Yeah. An epic breakdown. Yeah. I</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:52</time>
<p>might I might, I might go for the bow tie next time. So I think</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:56</time>
<p>that the joke is that whenever there's a panel on, like, In</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:05:59</time>
<p>DC or C SPAN if you don't live in DC.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:04</time>
<p>The the the one with the bow tie is always the troublemaker and sometimes that's</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:07</time>
<p>the moderator. I think they're chosen on purpose. So</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:11</time>
<p>I'm not sure if it's a compliment. Yeah. I've been chosen to moderate</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:15</time>
<p>a panel. But I'll be doing a demo Oh, and,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:20</time>
<p>you know, basically kinda how this, how OpenShift AI works.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:24</time>
<p>And, Oh, yeah. My car's in trouble. That's awesome. Go</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:28</time>
<p>for the bow tie. Yeah. I think I shall. I think I</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:31</time>
<p>shall. Given that this is, I didn't wanna</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:35</time>
<p>go too far out, so I have, like, a little suit, going</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:39</time>
<p>on. That's not a little. But, Yeah. So I'm</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:43</time>
<p>I'm really looking forward to this. Looks like if the weather holds, there'll be some</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:46</time>
<p>outdoor dining, outdoor catering stuff. Really pretty space.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:50</time>
<p>Really pretty event space. Raleigh is a cool</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:53</time>
<p>little town. And,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:06:58</time>
<p>Frank, I didn't just buy a house last year.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:07:02</time>
<p>You just moved to it. But I just bought a house last year, so</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:07:07</time>
<p>That option, kids, is on the table. Because I don't wanna put my</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:07:11</time>
<p>kids through it. Like, I don't let the school transition and stuff like that. So</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:07:14</time>
<p>but it's a cool little place. It's a cool place.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:07:18</time>
<p>Alright. So we wanna go back in. I'm gonna turn down the volume of my</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:07:22</time>
<p>voice a bit. And,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:07:27</time>
<p>there we go. There's the whole event.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:07:31</time>
<p>And, So if you're in the wrong area,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:07:35</time>
<p>stop by. I think it's happening tomorrow. They're doing workshops.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:07:38</time>
<p>And, today</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:07:42</time>
<p>Is the presentation part of it. So with that, I'm gonna</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:07:46</time>
<p>grab myself a cup of coffee, and,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:07:53</time>
<p>check it out. And I have to say, I saw this</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:07:56</time>
<p>online the other day where, like, the best track of any is the hall</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:08:00</time>
<p>track. Right? All the conversations you hear in the hallway. I love he picked it</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:08:04</time>
<p>up, but I heard a guy kinda talking about his opinion on, public cloud</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:08:07</time>
<p>versus private cloud. Very interesting. So I'm looking forward to</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:08:11</time>
<p>see what they're gonna discuss today. And,</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:08:17</time>
<p>We'll see the stage.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:08:20</time>
<p>And if you're in Raleigh, you're wrong, it's not</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:08:24</time>
<p>I believe we've got a session to sleep. And, come on. Check it</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:08:28</time>
<p>out. I'm gonna get myself a cup of coffee and be ready for the show.</p>
<p></p>
<cite>Speaker:</cite>
<time>00:08:31</time>
<p>Thanks. And you</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
